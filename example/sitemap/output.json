Homeowners often think about their heating systems and windows when preparing for colder weather, but have you considered what could be going on in your attic? Restoring your attic could be the best thing you do for your home this fall.\n\nCOMMON ATTIC PROBLEMS\n\nThe attic is an often-neglected part of the home, and that means it is often the most troublesome area. Some of the most common issues in attics are inadequate insulation, mold from improper ventilation or lack of insulation, and pest infestation.\n\nINADEQUATE INSULATION\n\nAbout 90% of American homes are under-insulated, especially in the attic where insulation matters most. When your attic is under-insulated, heated indoor air escapes through the roof of your home, making your heating system work harder than it needs to during the winter. Meanwhile, during the summer, hot outdoor air comes into your home through the attic, putting your air conditioner into overdrive.\n\nMOLD\n\nAttic ventilation has several purposes, the most important being moisture control. When mold accumulates on the underside of the roof decking, it is a sign that too much moisture is entering the attic without being vented to the outside. An attic that does not have adequate insulation is also highly prone to having mold problems. Not only will indoor air quality be affected, but building materials in the attic can eventually deteriorate from moisture buildup.\n\nPEST INFESTATION\n\nPests such as mice and rats can enter the attic through even the smallest of holes and cracks. Once they take shelter in your attic, they’ll leave behind unpleasant odors and waste — and potentially damage your home.\n\nBENEFITS OF ATTIC RESTORATION\n\nAttic restoration involves cleaning out the attic space, removing animal waste, sealing gaps, installing new insulation, and ensuring adequate ventilation. When done correctly by a professional, attic restoration can offer several benefits for your home:\n\nRemoving animal waste, debris, and moldy insulation improves indoor air quality.\n\nProper ventilation further improves indoor air quality throughout entire home.\n\nSealing gaps keeps pests out and prevents air from leaking into and out of your home, which helps to keep you more comfortable and saves you money.\n\nInstalling insulation increases home comfort, reduces energy consumption, and reduces your heating and cooling bills.\n\nWhether you live in Rockford; nearby in Loves Park, Cherry Valley, or New Milford; or further south in DeKalb or Sycamore, you can trust Greenlink Energy Solutions to restore your attic. Our professionals will restore your attic to pristine condition while making your home more energy efficient. We will get the job done right the first time so you won’t need to worry about future maintenance.\n\nReady to restore your attic this fall?

IT’S NOT YOUR WINDOWS\n\nJan 31, 2018\n\nDrafts are an all-too-familiar phenomenon for homeowners here in northern Illinois — especially now that the freezing temperatures and fierce winds of winter have arrived. Many homeowners in the area believe that their windows and doors are to blame for their winter comfort woes, but the cause of indoor drafts is often something less obvious.\n\nTHE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DRAFTS\n\nThe most common cause of drafts isn’t old windows; it’s a lack of insulation, along with air leaks in the home’s building envelope. When your house contains air leaks and lacks proper insulation, heat rises freely into the attic and goes straight through the roof during the winter. This creates a vacuum effect which pulls cold outdoor air in through leaks in lower areas of the home. You experience this as cold, uncomfortable drafts.\n\nFIND THE SOURCE OF DRAFTS WITH AN ENERGY AUDIT\n\nIf you want to target those drafts in your home, your best bet is to schedule a home energy audit. During a home energy audit, an energy expert will use high-tech equipment to inspect your house for efficiency issues such as air leaks and gaps in insulation. Through a blower door test, for example, your energy expert will measure how much air leakage there is in your home’s building envelope. Through thermal imaging, meanwhile, your energy expert will pinpoint exactly where those air leaks are. After the energy audit, you will receive a detailed report about your home’s efficiency along with a list of recommendations on improvements you should make. Air sealing and installing new insulation are often at the top of this list of recommendations.\n\nGREENLINK: WE’LL MAKE YOUR HOME MORE COMFORTABLE\n\nTired of drafts keeping you attached to your blankets during the winter? Talk to a home efficiency expert about how you can eliminate those drafts for good. In addition to complete home energy audits, Greenlink Energy Solutions offers free visual inspections to help homeowners understand which improvements can make their homes more comfortable and efficient. We also deliver home performance and HVAC solutions like air sealing and insulation to target issues like drafts at the root cause.

You can with an energy assessment. An energy assessment, also known as an energy audit, gives you an in-depth look at the overall efficiency of your home. It’s a lot like a doctor’s check-up, only it’s for your home.\n\nMost people wouldn’t attempt to diagnose a serious health condition on their own. The same logic should apply for diagnosing your home. Rather than attempting to locate the source of your indoor drafts or guessing that you need a new heating system, it’s important to have a professional help you locate problem areas and recommend effective solutions for improving efficiency.\n\nWHAT’S INCLUDED IN AN ENERGY ASSESSMENT?\n\nAn energy assessment includes a number of diagnostic tests involving special equipment to locate inefficiencies in the home. Key components include:\n\nBLOWER DOOR TESTING\n\nThis test involves placing a large fan in an exterior doorway. The fan draws air from the house to create negative pressure, allowing a professional to measure the overall amount of air leakage.\n\nINFRARED IMAGING\n\nInfrared cameras are used to detect hot and cold spots in a home. These spots indicate where outdoor air leaks in and conditioned air escapes, as well as areas where walls, floors, and ceilings lack insulation. Infrared imaging can pinpoint air leaks and problem areas that you couldn’t spot with a visual inspection alone.\n\nCOMPLETE VISUAL INSPECTION\n\nIn addition to testing with diagnostic equipment, a visual inspection by a professional helps locate efficiency issues such as outdated windows, HVAC issues, or problems with the building envelope.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF HIRING A PROFESSIONAL\n\nAs you can see, a comprehensive home energy assessment is not something you can easily DIY. It involves high-tech equipment which must be operated by a highly trained professional who understands fundamental home performance principles. Even during a visual inspection, it takes a trained eye to locate certain efficiency issues within a home. In order to get the most accurate information possible about your house, you need an experienced professional at your side.\n\nIn addition to giving you valuable information about the health of your house, an energy professional can also offer recommendations on which improvements to make for maximum energy savings and return on investment. They might, for example, recommend attic restoration to prevent ice dams on your roof in the winter. A professional can even simplify the process of improving your home by giving your an estimate for recommended upgrades.\n\nHAVE THE GREENLINK EXPERTS DIAGNOSE YOUR HOME\n\nWant to get to the bottom of your indoor comfort and efficiency issues? The certified experts at Greenlink can help. As a complete home performance contractor, we can help you determine exactly what your house in the Rockford, IL area needs, and then design a custom energy saving solution for you.\n\nReady to start enhancing home comfort and efficiency?\n\nRECENT POSTS\nWhy Fall Is the Ideal Season To Insulate Your Home\nHow Home Insulation Helps Fight Climate Change\nThe Main Elements of a Green and Healthy Home\nThe Importance of Green Building Science for Homeowners\nSteps To Make Your Home More Sustainable\nRECENT COMMENTS\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

One of the most commonly under-insulated areas is the attic.\n\nBut before you go ahead and insulate or reinsulate your attic, you should talk to a professional to make sure your attic is the real culprit in your home’s energy inefficiency. In the meantime, there are some definite signs that your attic very likely has no insulation, is poorly insulated or has old insulation that needs removal and updating.\n\nARE THESE SIGNS FAMILIAR TO YOU?\n\nIf you’ve noticed any or all of these signs, you should consider scheduling an energy audit, which will probably indicate that your attic insulation needs to be upgraded.\n\n1. HIGH ENERGY BILLS\n\nIf your furnace runs constantly but you still don’t feel quite warm enough, your house is leaking heat and wasting your energy dollars. Your home may benefit from overall air sealing (your energy audit will tell you if this is the case) and additional insulation.\n\n2. DRAFTS & UNEVEN HEATING OR COOLING THROUGHOUT YOUR HOUSE\n\nHave you ever heard of the stack effect? That’s what happens when air rushes into your lower floors through gaps in your house to replace the warm air and heat rising and escaping through your under-insulated and leaky attic. The colder it is, the more quickly this phenomenon occurs, causing the biggest drafts on the coldest days.\n\n3. BARE SPOTS ON YOUR ROOF\n\nHeat continues to unless it’s stopped by an adequate thermal barrier. This is the job of your insulation, but if your attic is not well insulated, it warms up and warms your roof. The bare spots on your roof represent a warm roof that melts snow and leaves bare patches, a sure sign of a poorly insulated attic.\n\n4. ICICLES AND ICE DAMS\n\nIcicles hanging down from your gutters indicate ice dams, which can cause serious problems if not remedied. Ice dams can be removed, but removing ice dams is not a solution as they will form again unless the root cause is addressed. It’s best to prevent ice dams from ever forming, and the best way to do that is to insulate your attic.\n\nTHE FIRST STEP TOWARD GREATER HOME COMFORT\n\nA more comfortable home and improved home performance begin with a home energy audit from Greenlink Energy Solutions. We’ll do a visual inspection of your entire home, inside and out, and use modern building science techniques, including a blower door test and infrared camera imaging, to determine just where your home is wasting energy.\n\nAfter your audit, we’ll provide recommendations for the most effective solutions to stop the waste. Attic insulation and air sealing often top the list of necessary improvements. The result: a more comfortable home all year long, significantly lower energy bills and a reduced environmental impact.\n\nNo matter what the findings of our energy audit are, the professionals at Greenlink can help with a wide range of solutions and expertise to ensure your investments provide the energy savings you need.\n\nMake sure your attic is helping the performance of your home, not hurting or bringing it down.

While most Rockford, IL area homeowners jump to solutions like spring cleaning and open windows for a fresher home, the surest way to freshen up your home this spring is with smart and simple energy efficiency upgrades.\n\nBy scheduling an energy audit and upgrades like air sealing and insulation, you can improve the overall health of your home, reduce allergy symptoms, increase home efficiency, and make your home more comfortable for the coming summer months.\n\nASSESS YOUR HOME WITH AN ENERGY AUDIT\n\nBefore you do anything else to your home this spring, be sure to schedule a home energy audit. A home energy audit conducted by an experienced professional will help you diagnose indoor comfort issues you’ve been having. It will also give you valuable information about home efficiency and tell you which areas in your home need the most attention as you make improvements.\n\nDuring your energy audit, for example, a professional will conduct a blower door test to assess your home’s overall air leakage levels. This test can reveal issues such as air leaks, missing insulation, and problems with your ductwork, pointing you to effective home improvements like insulation and air sealing.\n\nAIR SEAL & INSULATE FOR COUNTLESS BENEFITS\n\nAir sealing and insulation are typically two of the first home improvements you should make after your home energy audit. Air sealing closes up holes and cracks that allow conditioned indoor air to escape and contaminated outdoor air to enter. Insulation, meanwhile, improves your home’s ability to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures, regardless of what the temperature is outside. Valuable indoor heat stays inside during the winter, while sweltering outdoor heat stays outside during the summer.\n\nBenefits of air sealing and insulating together include:\n\nBetter Indoor Air Quality — Less Pollutants and Dust\nReduced Allergy Symptoms\nGreater Indoor Comfort\nIncreased Home Efficiency\nLower Heating & Cooling Bills\nFRESHEN UP YOUR HOME WITH GREENLINK ENERGY SOLUTIONS\n\nFor a fresher Illinois home this spring, you need smart solutions from Greenlink Energy Solutions.

If you’re a homeowner in the Rockford, Illinois, area, make sure you’re taking the right steps to control humidity and moisture inside your home.\n\nTHE DANGERS OF UNCONTROLLED MOISTURE\n\nWater can be one of your home’s worst enemies — even in the small amounts that are carried in humid air. Uncontrolled moisture can lead to home damage and even affect your health.\n\nSTRUCTURAL DAMAGE\n\nWhen air is allowed to leak into your house through unsealed vents, gaps, and cracks, it brings outside moisture with it. This results in condensation on ductwork, moisture buildup on insulation, and even mold growth. When left unchecked, excess moisture will rot the structure of your home.\n\nHEALTH ISSUES\n\nMold releases spores that can easily travel into your living areas, harming your indoor air quality and your health. Mold is hazardous to human health, exacerbating existing breathing conditions, like asthma, and irritating the eyes, nose, throat, and skin. People with weakened immune systems are particularly affected by mold.\n\nUNPLEASANT ODORS\n\nMold and mildew cause unpleasant odors and will destroy any belongings you have stored in damp areas of your home. Unless the mold is removed, the odors will persist and eventually be noticeable in your living areas.\n\nSTEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO AVOID MOISTURE PROBLEMS\n\nTaking the appropriate steps will ensure moisture is no longer a problem for home or health.\n\nWEATHERIZATION\n\nWeatherization is a broad term for the many steps you can take to ensure your home’s building envelope is protecting you and your living spaces from the conditions outside, including unwanted moisture. Weatherization, such as insulation upgrades, air sealing, and window upgrades, will better protect your home against moisture, improve your indoor air quality, increase the overall comfort of your home, and reduce your energy bills.\n\nVENTILATION\n\nProper ventilation will further ensure the humidity levels in your home stay at constant, optimum levels for building safety and your health. From whole-house filtration systems to exhaust fans, there are many ways to keep fresh air circulating throughout your home and prevent the buildup of toxic pollutants that can interfere with healthy indoor air quality.\n\nAIR SEALING\n\nAir sealing keeps moist air from moving freely into your home during the hot summer months. With insulation, it also keeps your warm air from escaping all winter. Air sealing makes for a more comfortable home, will prolong the life of your HVAC system, and significantly reduces your home energy costs.\n\nWe look at your whole house as a system, taking into account everything from siding and windows to insulation, air sealing and ventilation, that can affect your home’s energy efficiency. Our home energy experts are qualified to suggest the best solutions for your home and lifestyle.\n\nTAKE CONTROL OF THE MOISTURE IN YOUR HOME TODAY.\nRECENT POSTS\nWhy Fall Is the Ideal Season To Insulate Your Home\nHow Home Insulation Helps Fight Climate Change\nThe Main Elements of a Green and Healthy Home\nThe Importance of Green Building Science for Homeowners\nSteps To Make Your Home More Sustainable\nRECENT COMMENTS\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

The winter blues creep in big time during the dark, cold months to affect minds and bodies alike. The weather around us and the temperature of our surroundings can sway our decisions. The cold also deeply affects the inside and outside of our homes. Tasks take longer, objects can easily break down, and frustration tends to rise.\n\nNevertheless, you can find success by creating the right conditions for the job at hand. If that job is spray foam insulation, it’s critical to understand why the cold and spray foam are not close friends. When is it too cold for spray foam insulation? Let’s take a closer look at the facts to determine the best time frame and circumstances for this type of insulation.\n\nSPRAY FOAM INSULATION: THE BASICS\n\nSpray foam is a handy tool for the right situations—a perfect means that acts as an insulating and weatherizing barrier. Even in the most extreme climates of dry heat, intense humidity, or frigid cold, spray foam insulation successfully acts as an air barrier material to keep buildings dry, which maintains good structural condition. For homeowners, this type of sealing moisture-control insulation is the key to regulate temperatures within their homes.\n\nSpray foam insulation is simple to understand, but the application process is a bit more complicated. The tricky question remains: when is it too cold for spray foam insulation? The answer is that spray foam can be installed in a majority of weather circumstances, but only with the right material and in the right environment. It’s all about making adjustments to reach the appropriate temperatures.\n\nCOMPONENT TEMPERATURES\n\nThe difficulty of applying spray foam insulation in the cold of the winter months lies in the issue of temperature variation. Spray foam likes to be applied to a comfortable, warm space, and it also has its own temperature sensitivity. The recommended air temperature range is around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature, as well as the temperature of the surfaces to be sprayed—which should be between 60 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit—must be maintained to remain consistent.\n\nSUBSTRATE TEMPERATURES\n\nInsulation contractors must be careful when applying the warm spray foam onto colder substrates or surfaces. Experienced insulation specialists can install spray foam insulation in less-than-ideal situations, but the best conditions will create the best adherence. Professionals may need to use more product to ensure an adequate air seal. A building must also stay heated after application to assure there’s proper curing to form a continuous barrier.\n\nIf you’re looking for insulation specialists to install spray foam insulation in your home, you’ve come to the right place.

However, you must first learn how to check for issues to identify problematic areas. You can only fix what you know is broken. Air travels in and out of your home in every little hole and crack, and these spots may be subtle or undetectable. To aid your understanding, we’ve compiled a list of methods to use to identify air infiltration areas. Here’s how to find air leaks in a home.\n\nBASIC TESTING FOR AIR LEAKS: DIY METHODS\n\nTo test your home for air-tightness, you can utilize several methods available to you with objects you most likely already have on hand or can pick up at the store. On a breezier day, you can hold a candle, lit incense stick, or thermal leak detector up to a window or doorframe where you suspect an air leak. If the candle flame flickers or blows out, you have an air leak. If the incense smoke blows inward or gets sucked outward, you have an air leak. If the indicator light of the thermal detectors flashes, you have an air leak. Simple but effective.\n\nADVANCED CONTRACTOR TESTING: BLOWER DOOR FANS\n\nNevertheless, every house is different. The above DIY methods are not ideal for everyone’s situation, especially older homes. For this reason, it’s ideal to call in a professional to take the guesswork out of finding advanced air leaks. One way how to find air leaks in a home is through the blower door scientific testing method. A blower door is a diagnostic tool that tracks air infiltration. This calibrated fan pinpoints potential gaps or cracks where even the faintest leak is present.\n\nContractors experienced with the experiment can easily identify thermal leaks through the inside and outside shells of a building. As the outside fan runs, a contractor walks through a home to identify the vulnerable spots where air seeps through. Through this testing, homeowners can have insight into which areas need correction and improvement.\n\nHOW TO FIX AIR LEAKS: PROPER SOLUTIONS AND INSULATION\n\nWhen getting to the root of your air leakage problem, it’s wise to know who to call to help fix these issues.

This is because of what it can create: a solid block of resistant material. Spray foam insulates against air, heat loss, sound, and even water vapor—making it an extremely effective and energy-efficient solution for a home.\n\nIn today’s ongoing culture that continually seeks home improvement, many homeowners turn to DIY avenues to save money on their home improvement projects. You may be wondering: can I do spray foam insulation myself? While it is a possibility, the real question to be asking is if you should do it yourself. Since this insulation material is composed of numerous chemicals, it needs to be handled with tact and care. Let’s break down the process a bit further.\n\nTHE SAFETY OF INSULATION INSTALLATION\n\nSpray foam insulation works wonderfully in both fresh construction and re-insulation projects to fill all kinds of spaces within your home. It’s sprayed as a liquid directly into cavity spaces, then expands out and hardens as it dries. This final, firm layer protects the space it has filled.\n\nFor safety purposes, it’s critical to note that not all spray foams are alike. Each has chemical compositions that can act in diverse ways. While the project may not be heavily labor-intensive, there’s a specific procedure to follow and a certain knack to it not all homeowners can handle off the bat. To save precious time and money, the insulation process should be controlled by a professional insulation contractor with proper equipment.\n\nSPRAY FOAM INSULATION COSTS\n\nHiring an experienced contractor can cost more than doing the work yourself. However, there are times when how-to articles found on the internet can’t meet the required standards of a project. For larger projects, it makes sense to stop questioning: can I do spray foam insulation myself?\n\nInstead, seek out DIY projects that are less complex than insulation installation and start researching for local contractors that can provide professional spray foam insulation at a reasonable cost. Request various estimates, as the average cost of spray foam will vary based on location, the size of the space being filled, and any other complicating factors.\n\nBENEFITS OF HIRING AN EXPERIENCED SERVICE\n\nHiring experts can be the best decision you make. Here at Greenlink Energy, we take care of everything in the installation process to ensure your home gets the most out of revamped insulation solutions. Our spray foam insulation service is top-notch, as we pay close attention to detail and approach each job as if it were being done in our own homes.\n\nAs a family-owned business, you can trust the quality of the work we continually provide to our Northern Illinois neighbors. If you want to reduce the overall use of your home’s energy, give us a call or fill out our online form today.\n\nRECENT POSTS\nWhy Fall Is the Ideal Season To Insulate Your Home\nHow Home Insulation Helps Fight Climate Change\nThe Main Elements of a Green and Healthy Home\nThe Importance of Green Building Science for Homeowners\nSteps To Make Your Home More Sustainable\nRECENT COMMENTS\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Without knowledge about life as we know it, we wouldn’t know why the seasons change. We wouldn’t know how to bake bread or tea. We wouldn’t know what to do when events go astray.\n\nSo, what do you know? What do you know about your home? What do you know about its energy efficiency? What do you know about home energy assessments? If this term is relatively unfamiliar to you, you can think about a home energy audit as a comprehensive check-up of your home’s energy use. This assessment helps homeowners discover ways their homes can effectively perform better. Let’s zoom in on a few key reasons why you need to get a home energy audit for your benefit.\n\nKNOWLEDGE IS POWER\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered just how energy efficient your home is, you can get clear answers with a home energy audit. When done by a professional energy expert, this assessment provides knowledge of problem areas in your home where there is pinpointed energy loss.\n\nOn top of this, you can expect a thorough audit to help you devise a plan for improvement by outlining ways your home can be further energy efficient. A home energy auditor can also assess health and safety issues existing in your home. This information will assist homeowners in prioritizing repairs to make smart, budget-friendly improvements to their homes.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nFor those looking to reduce their carbon footprint, keep in mind that environmental impact is one of the top reasons why you need to get a home energy audit. Energy is an integral part of life in modern society that we often use without thinking. Our energy use has a dynamic ramification on the environment, and many sources of its use are found in our living spaces. You can expect to boost energy efficiency in your home after an energy audit, which is a clear-cut means to climate change mitigation.\n\nCOST SAVINGS AND COMFORT GALORE\n\nWhen you have a more eco-conscious house, you can save massive amounts of money. Certain upgrades may have ampler influence over others, but there’s no denying the collective comfort enhancement that adds value and tranquility to your space. The energy-saving plan an auditor suggests can cultivate greater health and enjoyment in the home.\n\nFor a quality home energy audit, turn to Greenlink Energy Solutions. We’re a local family-owned company that specializes in insulation, indoor air quality, efficiency, and restoration. Our Greenlink Energy Audit finds the cause of excessive energy bills to recommend a plan for energy efficiency improvements. We’re here to help you conserve both energy and cash.

As you’re thinking about the process of the project and considering available options on the market, it’s a good idea to learn more about the materials you can select from to make a knowledgeable decision. Installing fresh material will remedy inadequate insulation—but not every insulation material is one and the same.\n\nSpray foam insulation and fiberglass insulation are the two most common materials chosen by homeowners today. To determine which material is best suited for your consultation project, we’ve compiled a general overview to explain the key distinctions between these options. Here is what to know about spray foam vs fiberglass insulation.\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST\n\nAt first glance, one type of material may appear as the better or more attractive option, but you should keep a few considerations in mind as you move forward. When reading and gathering information about these insulation materials, consider what type most suits your budget, the scope and scale of your project, and your own personal needs or preferences. Each of these factors will influence your final choice.\n\nFIBERGLASS: A POPULAR, CONVENTIONAL GO-TO\n\nUndeniably, fiberglass is a common type of insulation material in homes across America. Due to its considerably lower upfront cost, it’s in a multitude of older homes nationwide. Fiberglass insulation is comprised of several components: recycled, melted glass, and supplementary raw materials. Once processed together, these materials form delicate, fibrous sheets known as batts.\n\nCost-effectiveness is what you need to know about spray foam vs. fiberglass insulation. Keep in mind that initial cost savings do not equal further savings in the future. Fiberglass installation is simple and provides a vaporous barrier, but it has proven to be less capably effective over time. You could consider, instead, newer insulation innovations.\n\nSPRAY FOAM: A FRESH, GREEN ALTERNATIVE\n\nSpray foam insulation is a chemical-based product many installation contractors use in modern homes. This foam is mixed on-site and applied directly with a sprayer. As a polymer, it effectively expands to fill a specified space of property upon application. Ergo, homeowners receive enhanced insulation, air blockage, and sealing with the use of open-celled or close-celled spray foam.\n\nSpray foam installation requires professionals who are experienced in precise insulation applications that require having excellent attention to detail.

All the energy-saving tips and tricks you’ve previously heard may—or may not—be true. With such a wide array of misinformation out there, where can you turn for advice?\n\nNever fear—we’re here to speak the truth and have compiled a list of energy-saving myths that are either based on assumptions or misunderstandings. Armed with this knowledge, you can find your way to a better understanding of energy efficiency and what solutions work. Without further ado, here are a few common myths about energy efficiency to debunk.\n\nMYTH: DISHWASHERS ARE LESS ENERGY EFFICIENT THAN WASHING BY HAND\n\nOut of all the common myths about energy efficiency, this misunderstanding has to be at the top of the list. If you can upgrade to Energy Star-certified devices, dishwashers these days are highly energy efficient with their variety of settings, offering access to cleaner dishes and less water waste. Since handwashing dishes requires a steady flow of hot water, you can use less water and save more money with an eco-friendly dishwasher. Keep in mind the goal is to reduce waste, so run dishwashers only when full.\n\nMYTH: CLOSED VENTS AND REGISTERS IN UNUSED ROOMS SAVE ENERGY\n\nThis common myth seems to makes sense, which is why many people engage in this practice for their households. Nevertheless, closing vents does not help to reduce energy use. Rather, this action directs airflow to the other rooms within your home. As a matter of fact, the pressure within your air system will only increase, work harder, and build up to greater energy waste.\n\nMYTH: IF A DEVICE OR OBJECT IS TURNED OFF, THEN IT’S NOT USING ENERGY\n\nMost any object plugged into an outlet uses energy, even if the object is not in use. The majority of electronic chargers use so-called “vampire power” when plugged in. They extract power even if they are not connected to a device. Similarly, plugged-in appliances do still draw power when turned off or not in use. The best energy-saving practices for your home include unplugging devices or appliances when not in use, as well as when you’re heading out for the day or out of town.\n\nFACT: ENERGY AUDITS ARE KEY SOLUTIONS TO SAVING ENERGY\n\nModern homes generate energy via a variety of sources, and in addition, internal and external factors influence overall energy efficiency. Homeowners can save energy and enhance comfort levels with a simple solution: a home energy audit. Energy assessments by energy audit companies examine your home’s structure and features to pinpoint areas where you can improve efficiency and save energy in the long run.\n\nFor a complete energy audit, turn to the professionals at Greenlink Energy Solutions. As a local and family-owned company, we desire to help our neighbors in Northern Illinois improve energy efficiency in their homes. To take the first step toward enhanced efficiency, fill out our online form for a free energy assessment or contact us today.

Spray foam insulation plays a critical role in building science, as its functions consider the whole-building approach. Whether used in commercial or residential buildings, spray foam is valuable insulation that safeguards against air leakage as a thermal and sound barrier. Spray foam insulation effectively supports the performance of supplementary building materials and construction systems of a home or property.\n\nSurely you have heard about spray foam before, but you may not be familiar with its inner processes. Are you curious about how this insulation does the trick so well? Let’s take a closer look at the science behind spray foam insulation: how it works.\n\nSIGNED, SEALED, AND DELIVERED: A PROVEN TOOL\n\nThe energy performance and comfort level of a building revolve around its insulation. Air leakage is a major problem for homeowners with a strong impact on heating and cooling bills. Of the various insulation options available today, spray foam is a green building material that proves a better barrier for cost savings and comfort. New and existing homes alike benefit from its solutions.\n\nThe development of spray foam consists of two main composite materials: polyurethane and isocyanate. The innovative mixture of these materials creates a chemical reaction that expands to fill a space, then efficiently hardens. The application of spray foam to an open cavity works wonders to form a barrier. During installation, spray foam expands up to 100 times to fill a structure’s every nook and cranny. Since spray foam is pliable and light, the insulation can move with a structure without cracking or pulling away.\n\nSPRAY FOAM: THE MAKING OF SUCCESSFUL SEALS\n\nThe science behind spray foam insulation and how it works is relatively simple. As mentioned above, contractors mix two components from diverse containers to create spray foam. Conventionally, the “A” side of the system contains the main liquids, while the “B” side is a blend of catalysts that creates a reaction as soon as the chemicals mix. This mixing process happens on-site using special equipment for the task at hand.\n\nWith professional rigs and proper tech, contractors can mix the foam perfectly and maintain the correct temperature. A suitable dispensing applicator gun offers flow control for precise installation. Keep in mind that certain manufacturers have their own spray foam blend, so be sure to ask your contractors about specific products and materials before installation.\n\nINSTALLATION THAT YIELDS RESULTS\n\nSpray foam application is a delicate process requiring knowledge of best practices and experience with the materials.

In our modern world, taking effective steps toward optimum energy efficiency is a green initiative—one that not only helps the planet but also reduces your monthly utility expenses. Knowledge of energy problems and efficient solutions to overcome them is key to achieving unrivaled comfort in your humble abode.\n\nHome energy audits are valuable tools that provide a clear-cut roadmap toward peak efficiency. Any time is a good time to take this initial first step toward improved energy savings. That said, there are several checklist items to go over before your auditor arrives. Here’s how to prepare for your home energy audit to get the most out of your personal assessment.\n\nPREPARE YOUR HOUSE FOR THE AUDITOR\n\nBefore an energy auditor arrives, you should have your home fully ready for an accurate and useful assessment. An auditor may request to analyze all areas of the home for your best benefit. Be sure to secure all pets or children and clear away clutter or belongings for quick access to hatches, attic spaces, crawl spaces, water heaters, boilers, and furnaces.\n\nTo make the process quick, easy, and efficient, close all windows and doors, open curtains, and raise any blinds. If your home has a fireplace, either empty the ash or cover it with a wet newspaper for inspection purposes.\n\nGATHER ENERGY BILLS AND CRITICAL INFORMATION\n\nWondering how else to prepare for your home energy audit? Collect your home’s utility and energy bills from the past year. The summary of your heating and electricity consumption details the history of your energy use to reveal beneficial information. An auditor can check over these bills to determine if anything seems right or wrong.\n\nDon’t forget to write down a list of knowledge about hot and cold spots, moisture or mold problems, allergy or pest problems, and general info about your home’s construction. These details can help the auditor diagnose issues directly related to air leakage, system performance, or insulation.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT FROM AN ENERGY ASSESSMENT\n\nNot all energy assessments are one-and-the-same. Be sure to check which specific testing, analysis, or inspection will occur prior to the audit taking place. Keep in mind that your home generates energy from a myriad of sources. Ergo, a variety of factors influence overall efficiency. The purpose of the audit is to ultimately pinpoint problem areas or issues your home has in order to tailor custom solutions for its needs.\n\nHomeowners can always turn to Greenlink Energy Solutions for their energy-saving needs. Our expert team provides purpose-built solutions following our home energy audit. As a local business, we’re here to help our Northern Illinois Neighbors. Contact us with any questions you may have about household energy efficiency or the Greenlink process.\n\nRECENT POSTS\nWhy Fall Is the Ideal Season To Insulate Your Home\nHow Home Insulation Helps Fight Climate Change\nThe Main Elements of a Green and Healthy Home\nThe Importance of Green Building Science for Homeowners\nSteps To Make Your Home More Sustainable\nRECENT COMMENTS\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Not to mention, it’s a dangerous threat to your property. Humidity levels are unpredictably fluctuating, alternating from room to room and from season to season. Higher moisture levels can wreak havoc on your home’s structure, surfaces, and overall condition. Maintaining balanced humidity levels is critical to not only enhance your health and comfort at home but also uphold your home’s ultimate dependability and air quality.\n\nDid you know that high-quality insulation offers your property extraordinary leverage over moisture control? In fact, humidity control and quality insulation walk hand in hand. A homeowner’s number one defense against this dank enemy is insulation. Here’s a closer look at how proper insulation helps with humidity control.\n\nEFFECTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY: FORMS A VAPOR BARRIER\n\nWe already know that insulation is an effective solution for energy efficiency. Controlling humidity levels is just another user-oriented remedy on its to-do list. Keep in mind how moisture tends to enter a home. The presence of moisture isn’t always obvious; rather, it’s quite subtle in nature. You may not visibly see water droplets or condensation, but moisture is constantly flowing in and out of a home via heat transfusion, material diffusion, and air movement. Moisture builds up naturally within a set structure.\n\nThis is exactly where wall, ceiling, and attic insulation come into the picture. A well-insulated property with the right kind of insulation will characteristically regulate its humidity levels to prevent moisture from seeping into diverse surfaces. Forming this protective barrier against vapors is how proper insulation helps with humidity control and lowers concerns about excessive moisture settlement.\n\nSPRAY FOAM INSULATION: A PROVEN DEFENSE\n\nA myriad of insulation options is available on the modern marketplace. Spray foam is the leading choice for moisture control against humidity due to its high R-value. An R-value refers to the material’s unique capability to resist heat transfer. Spray foam creates unfailing insulated ceilings and walls due to its specific properties. Even if the material were to become damp, no mold would form or impede the effectiveness of the insulation. Any worries about storing unnecessary moisture will disappear.\n\nIf your home is in need of insulation specialists to help control air flow and moisture levels, turn to Greenlink Energy Solutions. We are professional insulation contractors helping our Northern Illinois neighbors experience comfort in their homes year-round. We offer a wide range of solutions to suit the goals and needs of individual homeowners, such as spray foam insulation and air sealing.

Keeping your home comfortable during this time proves a balancing challenge. An efficient strategy is key to not only beating the ever-present heat but also utilizing energy-efficient practices. For your consideration, here are a few methods outlining how to save energy while cooling your home.\n\nUSE OF WINDOWS AND COVERINGS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE\n\nA wide majority of people love to let in the sunshine, but natural sunlight can cause a rise in interior temperatures during the hottest times of the day. Smart management of your home’s east- and west-facing windows can reduce heat gains by at least half. Coverings such as blinds and curtains also support temperature control to keep hot air out of the home.\n\nIf you choose to open windows during warmer days, be sure to do so only during the mornings or later evenings. Opening opposite-facing windows is a good method to create an effective cross-breeze without needing air conditioning.\n\nPLANT GREENERY IN KEY AREAS\n\nInterestingly enough, utilizing exterior greenery is one beneficial way for how to save energy while cooling your home. This strategic approach is more passive than active. Nonetheless, such a game plan assists with shading selective areas or guiding breezy winds toward your home. Similar to the installation benefits of window shutters or blinds, mindfully placed trees, plants, and shrubbery shade windows and prevent the blaze of direct sunlight from entering specific interior spaces. Choose fast-growing options from which you can profit in the coming years as penumbrae.\n\nUPGRADE YOUR INSULATION\n\nMany people consider insulation most critical during the freezing winter months. The fact of the matter is, quality insulation serves just as critical functions during the summer months. Air that escapes from doors, windows, and other crevices is a common culprit of poor cooling in your home’s interior. Proper insulation works wonders for keeping cool air inside by forming a solid barrier and controlling humidity. The magic of foam insulation plays an integral role in the maintenance of a consistent, comfortable temperature.\n\nA proper air barrier truly makes all the difference.

For the sake of the environment and one’s wallet, individuals can do their part to protect the longevity of their homes—and their home planet of Earth. The leading action of this endeavor is the thermal protection of one’s residence through quality insulation installation. This essential pursuit controls lasting durability, lowers the cost of utility and operation, and provides amplified comfort levels all year round.\n\nFiberglass and spray foam insulation are notable names on the list of common insulation materials. However, cellulose is an option growing in popularity due to its sustainable origins and incredible properties. Instead of throwing energy out the window—or door, attic, or wall—consider the following advantages of cellulose insulation.\n\nCELLULOSE INSULATION: RECYCLED CONTENT\n\nModern homeowners have a wide assortment of quality insulation choices up to their selection. Cellulose insulation is a strong contender on the market for its content properties, making efficient use of natural resources and reducing waste. This type of organic insulation is comprised of loose recycled paper.\n\nErgo, cellulose insulation is a wise choice for sustainable homeowners who desire to repurpose content. As an eco-friendly green home product, cellulose is safe to handle and be around without any health hazards—not to mention its non-toxic biodegradability for the future.\n\nAIR-TIGHT WALL APPLICATION\n\nYou’ll find that, dollar for dollar, this insulation offers ideal insulating power. Cellulose insulation has a high-rated R-value of around 3.5 per inch of thickness, which means it has a high insulation capacity. The actual R-value depends on the depth and density of insulation, but cellulose insulation remains a superb air-blocker against leakage and drafts. Tightly packed cellulose provides a thermally efficient solution upon application, adequately treated to help prevent fire, mold growth, and insect infiltration.\n\nPRIME ENERGY-SAVING SOLUTIONS\n\nOut of all the advantages of cellulose insulation, its continual provision of energy savings leads the crowd. With high-performance insulating properties and adequate energy cost per installed R-value unit, homeowners can use this insulation’s benefits to cut down on their energy bills. When you use cellulose insulation, a healthier, more comfortable home environment is right around the corner.\n\nTurn to Greenlink Energy for reliable insulation contractors. As the preferred insulation specialists in the Northern Illinois area, we offer home performance upgrades for our local neighbors through cellulose or spray foam insulation. Our extensively experienced team also specializes in energy assessments and renewable energy solutions to fit the personal needs of one’s property.

This multipurpose material is an innovative remedy that works wonders to reduce energy use and prevent air leakage and infiltration. Not to mention its other perks—such as minimizing heating and cooling costs—can help create a comfortable home environment for years to come.\n\nIf you need to fill in cracks, holes, and air leaks in your living spaces, foam insulation is a beneficial option that expands to fit within a specified area and quickly hardens, providing an adequate barrier against undesirable materials. Regardless of this product’s versatility, spray foam isn’t foolproof. Let’s take a look at the areas in your home that are typically off-limits. Here’s where not to use expanding spray foam insulation.\n\nAROUND ELECTRICAL OUTLETS OR BOXES\n\nSpray foam provides an effective air barrier when properly installed, making it a popular choice for difficult-to-insulate spaces. However, one area where we would not advise to use expanding spray foam insulation is in spaces too close to electrical mechanisms, such as outlets or boxes. If foam were to get inside the box or outlet, the components could jam up.\n\nMost critically, the spray foam contains flammable chemicals that could spark a fire when exposed to electrical parts. Expanding insulation should not be used in or around these parts or other electrical wiring—it’s not worth the safety risk.\n\nUP ON THE ROOFTOP\n\nThe use of spray foam on the roof of a home is a debated topic in the industry. While expert contractors have previously accomplished this spray foam application, it generally isn’t recommended. Out of the wide array of roofing insulation options, the use of open-cell spray foam is not a good option.\n\nA variety of problems can arise, such as trapped water, increased moisture, and potential spoiling. Furthermore, the majority of residential homeowners undoubtedly wouldn’t want a spray foam roof for aesthetic reasons.\n\nCLOSED-CAVITY SPACES\n\nRates of expansion differ between types of insulation foam, which can reduce the efficiency of the insulation. This relates to the next area of installation limitation. If you were to install expanding spray foam insulation in a closed cavity, you could potentially end up with damaged drywall or spots void of proper insulation. The foam may not cure due to the lack of air and moisture. It’s difficult to say what coverage you would receive.\n\nWHEN IN DOUBT, CONSULT WITH EXPERTS\n\nSpray foam insulation is best installed by professionals who have the tools and experience to ensure the job is done safely and adequately. Expertise and attention to detail are essential to overcome challenges for the project at hand.\n\nFor an experienced spray foam insulation contractor in Northern Illinois, reach out to our team at Greenlink Energy Solutions. Our spray foam insulation service forms a continuous barrier to ensure even home temperatures. We can say with certainty that even the smallest gaps of insulation can highly impact the comfort level of your home.

Choosing to go green is one step closer to protecting the longevity of our planet—and keeping more money in our pockets for rainy days. Many methods exist today to decrease one’s carbon footprint and live a more sustainable life.\n\nHomeowners can make use of what is available to them to ensure a better quality of life. Even the smallest changes can help reduce the pressuring stress wreaking havoc on the environment. Let’s take a closer look at how to do so. Here is a general list of steps to take to make your home more sustainable.\n\nSELECT ECO-FRIENDLY MATERIALS AND APPLIANCES\n\nOut of the varying steps to take to make your home more sustainable, utilizing environmentally friendly materials and resources in your home is first on the list. Getting serious about lifestyle choices and habits, such as cutting down on water or electricity use, is a holistic approach for saving natural materials. Also, intentionally selecting household products that cause less harm to the environment is of the essence. Consider investing in energy-star appliances, high-performance windows, water-saving fixtures, LED lighting, recycled materials or fabrics, and toxic-free cleaning products.\n\nOPTIMIZE FOR SOLAR POWER\n\nSolar panels are a fundamental feature of an eco-friendly home. Solar design is a brilliant way to increase renewable energy while minimizing authority costs. Clean electricity produced from roof-installed solar panels is a long-term sustainable investment. Do keep one thing in mind about retrofitting solar: this decision is not a mere monetary expenditure. Any remodeling or revamping choice is a distinct opportunity to live more sustainably in the present and save for the future.\n\nEVALUATE AND INSULATE THE HOME PROPERLY\n\nAir sealing any tiny gaps or cracks is the key to saving energy and creating a more comfortable home. In the colder months, any escaping air leaking from these pockets is equivalent to leaving a window wide open. Professionally insulating your walls, floors, and attic is integral to minimize heating and cooling costs on your energy bills. An array of sustainable insulation is available, such as cellulose and spray foam.\n\nProfessional spray foam insulation companies can help you properly insulate your home. Turn to Greenlink Energy for your insulation service needs. As a family-owned company in the Northern Illinois area, our team of expert contractors seals gaps to provide lifelong, sustainable value. We also offer an energy audit service to help homeowners uncover more tactics and approaches for going green.

A structured building’s lifecycle is responsible for the consumption of numerous natural resources. Regardless of whether a building is commercial or residential, the growth and development of communities mightily influence our environment. Past statistics reveal that around 40 percent of the energy utilized in America is from buildings alone.\n\nThis is where the vitality of efficient building science comes into play. A foundation of solid building science and critical thinking creates high-performing, eco-friendly, and cost-saving residential homes. Let’s take a closer look at the importance of green building science for homeowners.\n\nBUILDING SCIENCE: THE BASICS\n\nSo, what is the importance of green building science for homeowners? Modern building science asks a simple question: how can we create comfortably efficient interior spaces without generating negative effects on Earth and humanity? Answering this very question requires the right approach—elements of architecture, physics, engineering, health, and environmental science. With the right background knowledge, design teams and contractors can create plans for a specific building or home that will provide apex comfort without supplementary harm. But how does this building science apply to existing homes? The answer lies directly in energy efficiency.\n\nWHY GO GREEN AT HOME?\n\nAny contractors that homeowners choose to hire to revamp or work on their homes should have a fundamental understanding of green building science. Green building at the core is about sustainable design. This practice is nothing new or revolutionary. From the beginning of time, humans built with local resources and materials, such as straw, mud, wood, and stone. They used renewable energy from the wind, sun, and water for power.\n\nOver time, technologies and innovations have changed the face of buildings, but the significance of structural efficiency has not been altered. Homes should be seen as entirely integrated systems, with various modifiable factors impacting heating, cooling, and energy control.\n\nBENEFITS: COMFORT AND EFFICIENCY\n\nGreen building science is critical to current homeowners to discover energy-saving techniques, practices, and strategies. Proper air sealing and insulation are key to reducing operating costs, improving occupant productivity, enhancing utility, and generating ultimate comfort and performance. Green retrofitting and remodeling are smart ways to get more value for your green dollar.\n\nLook no further than Greenlink Energy for a spray foam insulation contractor.

As economist Ross Garnaut states, “The side of the chasm we are now on is a dangerous place. It would be reckless for us to stay where we are.”\n\nThe most reliable method to slow down the threat of climate change is the reduction of carbon emissions. But what is the world’s greatest polluter? Human activity. Infrastructures, buildings, and enterprises are major contributors to global warming—as are residential homes. Building and upgrading homes with eco-friendly features are key to alleviate CO2 emissions. Let’s examine how insulation plays into this endeavor. Here’s a closer look into how home insulation helps fight climate change.\n\nREDUCES ENERGY CONSUMPTION\n\nMinimizing carbon emissions in the building science industry takes on numerous forms. Most residential building-related carbon emissions stem from energy use. Insulation is one such category that’s integral in the face of climate change. Home insulation serves as a solution to address energy consumption concerns. The simplest step lies in creating energy-efficient infrastructure and design. Did you know that older homes lose over a quarter of their heat through their walls? Green insulation reduces the energy requires to heat and cool a home efficiently.\n\nBUILDS STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE IN STRUCTURE\n\nImproving building structure is one way how home insulation helps fight climate change in the western world. Adapting and retrofitting existing homes with upgraded insulation is a proven strategy to offset carbon emissions. According to Energy Star, around 90 percent of American homes remain under-insulated. Incorporating insulation into our dwellings strengthens their structure with a resilient and valuable barrier against air leaks and other environmental problems.\n\nAIMS FOR CARBON-NEUTRAL PERFORMANCE\n\nAn exceptionally well-insulated and airtight home is one of the main functional design goals of a zero-carbon building. High-performing green buildings and residences provide ample means to reduce the climate impacts of these structures and their inhabitants. By helping maximize energy efficiency, better home insulation proves to be a leading accessible and cost-effective tactic to combat the climate change crisis.\n\nIf you’re a homeowner who’s interested in new insulation for your residence, turn to experienced insulation specialists to get the job done right. Here at Greenlink Energy, our team’s mission is to enhance health, comfort, and home efficiency in every way possible. We desire to improve the homes of our local neighbors with insulation that saves money and lowers one’s environmental impact.

Are you a fall person who craves the slight chill in the air or the crunch of a fallen leaf under your foot? Regardless of whether you’re fond of the season or not, now is prime time to begin thinking about the colder days that lie ahead. How prepared are you and your home?\n\nWhen your mind is on home efficiency, one factor reigns the highest of all: insulation. Insulation is key to maintain the comfort of your interior for many seasons to come. Consider whether your humble abode could benefit from a reinvigorating insulation installation over these next couple of months. Here’s a quick peek into why fall is the ideal season to insulate your home.\n\nJUST RIGHT CONDITIONS: COOLER AND DRIER WEATHER\n\nThe mild weather is the leading reason why fall is the ideal season to insulate your home—especially if you’re located in the Midwest. The hot summer months, wet spring months, or freezing winter months can make insulation more difficult or potentially dangerous. Too much moisture could also become trapped between insulation layers and cause future efficiency issues. Fall brings those milder temperatures and drier air conditions, which is ideal for safely installing insulation.\n\nTACKLE YOUR WINTER PREP CHECKLIST EARLY\n\nInstalling insulation before the freezing cold arrives at your doorstep has its perks. If you wait until you feel the icy wind against your home’s interiors, you’ll be too late to save yourself from shivering hassles and untimely headaches. Insulating in the fall means getting ahead of the cost-efficiency game. You and your family will have true comfort when winter rears its monstrous head.\n\nSAVE TIME AND MONEY: USE A LOCAL CONTRACTOR\n\nHomeowners can experience cost savings when deciding to install insulation this autumnal season. Maximizing money savings on household electricity and utility bills is a breeze—all you need is the right insulation installer to keep the cozy heat in as the weather begins to cool down.\n\nIf you’re noticing a drafty home interior or think your energy bills are too high, turn to the experts at Greenlink Energy. We are a preferred insulation contractor in Northern Illinois with a mission to enhance home efficiency in every possible way. Greenlink is here with prompt insulation installation solutions.

Rebates for energy-efficient upgrades are available to all current residential Nicor Gas customers, and participation is simple.\n\nWe are part of a network of approved contractors to secure Nicor Gas rebates. Once work is completed, we make the rebate process as quick and streamlined as possible. \n\nNicor offers rebates for the following upgrades and services: air sealing, attic insulation, duct sealing and installation of new furnaces, boilers and thermostats. \n\nhttps://www.nicorgas.com/residential/ways-to-save/rebates.html.html\n\nPEOPLE’S GAS\n\nOwners of single-family homes, two-flats and individually metered condos, apartments and townhomes in the City of Chicago can get rebates on a wide range of energy-saving improvements to their buildings. People’s Gas offers attic insulation, wall insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, HVAC, water heater and weatherization rebates.\n\nhttps://www.peoplesgasdelivery.com/savings/rebates-residential\n\nNORTH SHORE GAS\n\nTake advantage of the North Shore Gas Energy Efficiency Program. Owners of single-family homes, two-flats and individually metered condos, apartments and townhomes in the northern suburbs of Chicago can get rebates on a wide range of energy-saving improvements to their buildings. North Shore Gas offers attic insulation, wall insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, HVAC, water heater and weatherization rebates.\n\nhttps://www.northshoregasdelivery.com/savings/rebates-residential\n\nFOCUS ON ENERGY\n\nReduce energy waste in your home and save money. Focus on Energy partners with over 100 Wisconsin utilities to help single-family homeowners, renters and property owners make energy-related improvements to their homes. Focus on Energy offers incentives to bring down the cost of insulation, air sealing and other HVAC upgrades.\n\nhttps://focusonenergy.com/residential#program-heating-and-cooling\n\nILLINOIS SHINES\n\nIllinois Shines is a state-administered program that offers financial incentives for new solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The program provides payments in exchange for 15 years of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) generated by new PV systems. These payments, made by Illinois utilities, vary depending on the system’s size and location.\n\nA home PV system might generate 50-200 RECs over 15 years. By participating in Illinois Shines, you will transfer the RECs from your PV system to an Illinois electric utility. Selling your RECs will not affect your PV system’s production.\n\nAlthough you can keep your RECs or sell them to someone besides utilities, participating in Illinois Shines — and thus allowing your RECs to be sold to a utility — is likely to be your best financial option. Selling your RECs through this program will make it more likely that your PV system will save you money.\n\nhttps://illinoisshines.com/\n\nFINANCING\nILLINOIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY LOAN PROGRAM\n\nEnergy-efficiency investments are a cost-effective means to decrease energy consumption, enhance building comfort and reduce utility bills. Despite the benefits of energy-efficient upgrades, high upfront costs can be a significant barrier to investing in energy improvements. The Illinois Energy Efficiency Loan Program allows utility customers to pay for investments through a monthly loan charge on their utility bill.\n\nResidential owner-occupied and tenant-occupied, single-family (1-4 unit) homes, condominiums and mobile homes could qualify for an unsecured loan (homeowner provides no collateral) added to a monthly utility bill. Borrowers can finance $500 – $20,000 at a fixed interest rate of 4.99% for a 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- or 10-year term. The Illinois Energy Efficiency Loan Programs works with most of the major utility providers of the state, including ComEd, Nicor Gas, People’s Gas and North Shore Gas.\n\nhttps://www.energyfinancesolutions.com/ForHomeowners-Illinois-Loan-Program\n\nENERGY FINANCE SOLUTIONS\n\nEnergy Finance Solutions offers customizable financing programs to meet your energy-efficiency and renewable-energy goals. Proactive loans are available for planned energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects. Reactive loans are also provided for unexpected system replacements, such as a failed furnace.\n\nhttps://www.energyfinancesolutions.com/aboutefs-productsandservices\n\nWISETACK\n\nGet flexible financing for your energy-efficiency upgrades through Wisetack. A short application process takes just a minute to learn your options without affecting your credit score.

You’ll often hear “rim joist” or “band joist” to describe the area where your exterior basement walls meet the outside. This is a common area for air penetration, which can lead to cold floors and temperatures in the winter and warm temperatures in the summer. Moisture damage and pest infestation can also occur in poorly insulated basements.\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Rebates for energy-efficient upgrades are available to all current residential Nicor Gas customers, and participation is simple.\n\nWe are part of a network of approved contractors to secure Nicor Gas rebates. Once work is completed, we make the rebate process as quick and streamlined as possible. \n\nNicor offers rebates for the following upgrades and services: air sealing, attic insulation, duct sealing and installation of new furnaces, boilers and thermostats. \n\nhttps://www.nicorgas.com/residential/ways-to-save/rebates.html.html\n\nPEOPLE’S GAS\n\nOwners of single-family homes, two-flats and individually metered condos, apartments and townhomes in the City of Chicago can get rebates on a wide range of energy-saving improvements to their buildings. People’s Gas offers attic insulation, wall insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, HVAC, water heater and weatherization rebates.\n\nhttps://www.peoplesgasdelivery.com/savings/rebates-residential\n\nNORTH SHORE GAS\n\nTake advantage of the North Shore Gas Energy Efficiency Program. Owners of single-family homes, two-flats and individually metered condos, apartments and townhomes in the northern suburbs of Chicago can get rebates on a wide range of energy-saving improvements to their buildings. North Shore Gas offers attic insulation, wall insulation, air sealing, duct sealing, HVAC, water heater and weatherization rebates.\n\nhttps://www.northshoregasdelivery.com/savings/rebates-residential\n\nFOCUS ON ENERGY\n\nReduce energy waste in your home and save money. Focus on Energy partners with over 100 Wisconsin utilities to help single-family homeowners, renters and property owners make energy-related improvements to their homes. Focus on Energy offers incentives to bring down the cost of insulation, air sealing and other HVAC upgrades.\n\nhttps://focusonenergy.com/residential#program-heating-and-cooling\n\nILLINOIS SHINES\n\nIllinois Shines is a state-administered program that offers financial incentives for new solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The program provides payments in exchange for 15 years of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) generated by new PV systems. These payments, made by Illinois utilities, vary depending on the system’s size and location.\n\nA home PV system might generate 50-200 RECs over 15 years. By participating in Illinois Shines, you will transfer the RECs from your PV system to an Illinois electric utility. Selling your RECs will not affect your PV system’s production.\n\nAlthough you can keep your RECs or sell them to someone besides utilities, participating in Illinois Shines — and thus allowing your RECs to be sold to a utility — is likely to be your best financial option. Selling your RECs through this program will make it more likely that your PV system will save you money.\n\nhttps://illinoisshines.com/\n\nFINANCING\nILLINOIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY LOAN PROGRAM\n\nEnergy-efficiency investments are a cost-effective means to decrease energy consumption, enhance building comfort and reduce utility bills. Despite the benefits of energy-efficient upgrades, high upfront costs can be a significant barrier to investing in energy improvements. The Illinois Energy Efficiency Loan Program allows utility customers to pay for investments through a monthly loan charge on their utility bill.\n\nResidential owner-occupied and tenant-occupied, single-family (1-4 unit) homes, condominiums and mobile homes could qualify for an unsecured loan (homeowner provides no collateral) added to a monthly utility bill. Borrowers can finance $500 – $20,000 at a fixed interest rate of 4.99% for a 1-, 3-, 5-, 7- or 10-year term.

At Greenlink Energy Solutions, we have a great deal of experience when it comes to installing unvented attic spray foam insulation. Read on to learn the benefits of unvented versus vented attics.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nUNVENTED ATTICS VERSUS VENTED ATTICS\n\nThere are two options available to those looking to mitigate energy loss via their attic and improve overall comfort levels in the home. The first option is to make your attic a vented attic, and the second option is to leave it unvented and fully insulated. We will briefly discuss the pros and cons associated with each of the two options, but the right one for you will depend on your home. As part of our 360° holistic approach to building science, we will evaluate each component of your home as a part of a system, which will help us determine your home’s current energy efficiency, which areas of the home need to be addressed and in what order they should be addressed, and which will allow us to outline a plan tailored specifically to your home.\n\nVENTED ATTICS\n\nVented attics make use of a combination of both intake and exhaust vents that allow for fresh outdoor air to enter the attic space, and hot indoor air to be pushed outside. These vents can either be static vents that allow for air to naturally enter and leave the space, or they can be powered fan vents that will push and pull air through the attic. This helps to improve your energy efficiency where heating and cooling the home is concerned.\n\nBut vented attics can introduce moisture into the attic, which can lead to mold growth. The attic will also likely experience temperature swings and will not be a suitable conditioned space for the storage of certain personal belongings.\n\nUNVENTED ATTICS\n\nAn unvented attic, also known as a conditioned attic, is a newer method of ensuring your attic is energy efficient. Rather than using vents, an unvented attic space requires that the attic be air sealed, preventing airflow from exiting or leaving the space. We then line the attic with spray foam insulation. This keeps your attic from getting too hot and prevents the heat in your attic from escaping.\n\nThis is, however, a more expensive attic insulation option. And you may have to check with your roofing contractor to ensure that the installation of an unvented attic will not nullify the warranty on your roofing. This is because, in the past, there were concerns that utilizing spray foam insulation could lead to the roof getting too hot, causing damage. While this isn’t the case, and many manufacturers have updated their warranty policy to allow for the installation of an unvented attic, you may want to double-check.\n\nWhich option is right for you may depend entirely on your home’s existing structure. But if you’re at all interested in learning more about unvented attic spray foam insulation, contact us today for a free assessment and estimate from the pros at Greenlink Energy Solutions. Let us help ensure your home is as comfortable and energy efficient as possible.\n\nFirst Name *\nLast Name *\nPhone *\nEmail Address *\nZip Code *\nAreas and Services of Interest (Optional)\nPick a Service\nGeneral Insulation\nHome Energy Audit / Assessment\nAttic\nBasement\nCrawl Space\nLiving Area\nWindows & Doors\nSpray Foam Insulation\nMessage *\nIf you are human, leave this field blank.\nGet Started\n779.774.3378 | info@greenlink.com\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions © 2021\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Every component of the home works together and intertwines.\n\nAn home energy audit is a full top-to-bottom inspection and analysis of the performance of your home. This assessment identifies and pinpoints where you’re losing comfort and energy across every area. The energy assessment will be conducted by a Building Performance Institute (BPI®) Certified professional who specializes in Greenlink’s 360° whole home building science approach. \n\nThere are two types of energy audits: simple and complex. At Greenlink, we believe the most effective method of improving a home begins with a complex, also known as a comprehensive, assessment. This is the first step towards reducing energy use and improving performance.\n\nTHE BENEFITS OF A HOME ENERGY ASSESSMENT\n\nEnergy audits are a powerful tool for uncovering opportunities for improvements that will save energy, reduce energy costs, and lead to higher performance.\n\nNo-cost operational or maintenance adjustments that will save you money and energy\nShort-term, low-cost energy efficiency retrofit recommendations\nAction plans, customized for your home’s needs, for energy efficiency capital investments\nComfort and code issues that can be addressed immediately\nOpportunities for better adherence to lighting, comfort, and building standards\nQualified to receive the Focus on Energy Home Improvement Incentives * Wisconsin Residents\nTHE GREENLINK HOME ENERGY AUDIT PROCESS\n\nThe auditor walks through each phase of the energy audit process with quality, experience, and your concerns in mind.\n\nPHASE 1 – CONSULTATION\n\nWe’ll talk to you about any concerns, questions, or comments you may have and then get you scheduled.\n\nPHASE 2 – SITE ASSESSMENT\n\nOur energy audit includes an array of tests and analyses to identify areas where your home could perform more efficiently and safely. After a visual inspection from roof to foundation, we’ll set up our building science diagnostic equipment to begin the testing. Some of the energy audit tests we will perform include:\n\nBlower Door Test — This powerful fan is fitted temporarily in an exterior doorway. When activated, the fan creates a negative pressure inside the building to measure air leakage.\nInfrared Camera Imaging — This allows us to “see” through walls and ceilings during blower door operation. The temperature differences show in bright colors where air leaks are allowing outside air to seep in, and where insulation is missing or inadequate.\nSafety Check — We’ll check for gas leakage and analyze your combustion appliances to measure and ensure that dangerous carbon monoxide fumes are not escaping into your living areas.\nAir Flow Meter — This device measures ventilation and air flow in bath and kitchen fans to ensure a healthy exchange for improved indoor air quality.\nPHASE 3 – ENERGY AND COST ANALYSIS\n\nThe auditor reviews all the collected data and works with the team to create customized solutions and recommendations for your home. This phase is where we identify which recommendations are the most cost effective and will pay for themselves in their lifespan.\n\nPHASE 4 – COMPLETION OF THE AUDIT REPORT\n\nThis information is then entered into the latest energy modeling software to provide you with an in-depth 25+ page report which lays out problems, problematic areas, areas of concern, safety warnings and hazards, but most importantly—recommendations which boost the performance and efficiency of your home. These can be additional insulation, lighting upgrades, window replacement, installing a new water heater, or even upgrading the old freezer in the garage.\n\nOnce the data is collected, we provide a complete report along with recommendations for ways to improve your home’s performance through a series of energy saving upgrades. This may include upgrading your attic insulation in order to prevent ice dams, or waterproofing your basement to prevent moisture and mold issues.\n\nBUILDING PERFORMANCE INSTITUTE (BPI) CERTIFIED ENERGY AUDITOR\n\nThe Building Performance Institute (BPI) is the nation’s premier standards development and credentialing organization for residential energy auditing and upgrade work. Our trained and certified technicians use scientific analysis and specialized tools to measure your home’s energy efficiency and safety, and you can rest easy knowing that each and every one of our home energy auditors has a BPI certification. Our certifications all under two specializations:\n\nBuilding Analyst to understand the home’s systems, including HVAC, ventilation, and insulation, and how they work together.\nEnvelope Professional focuses on the exterior of the home to ensure the highest energy efficiency.\n\nWant to know how your home is performing, think you could use some efficiency upgrades?

      "source": " \nSelect Page\nTHE HOME ENVELOPE—COMPONENTS OF YOUR HOME\nEvery area of your home works together with another. We analyze the entire home as a system to provide the best results.\n\nTHE BUILDING ENVELOPE\n\nThe exterior of your home is referred to as the “envelope,” which protects you from the elements. Your envelope regulates how air moves in and out of the home, repels moisture and pests, and prevents conditioned air from escaping to the outside. Issues with your building envelope can have a big impact on your utility bills, comfort, and health.\n\nGreenlink’s 360° diagnostics approach examines the critical relationships between your systems and develops a customized proposal for solutions to maximize your health, comfort, and energy efficiency.\n\nOUR DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE\n\n1. Consultation and Addressing Concerns & Priorities\n\nOur trained assessors will visit your home, address your concerns, and help you prioritize energy efficient improvements. Sometimes energy problems are obvious — you know if your furnace doesn’t work or your attic doesn’t have any insulation. However, it can be much more challenging to know how to fix that one room that won’t cool down or how to reduce rising heating bills.\n\n2. Complete 6-Point Visual Inspection\n\n\nThe assessor will conduct a thorough 6-point visual inspection of the key areas and sources of vulnerabilities within your home’s building envelope. They’ll use thermal imaging, moisture testing, identify air leaks and infiltration, test your air quality, and notate any aspect of the home that may be contributing to an issue or may need attention.\n\n3. Collaboration and Analysis\n\nUpon completion of the assessment, the assessor will collaborate with the Greenlink Envelope team to create a unique proposal tailored to your home that will address your needs. Every home and building is unique and, at Greenlink, is treated as such. You will receive a detailed report listing all notes and observations along with information regarding any problems discovered during the assessment. Our goal is to have you understand exactly what your home needs, why, and how to accomplish it.\n\nATTIC & HOME INSULATION\n\nDid you know up to 90% of homes lack sufficient attic insulation according to the U.S. Department of Energy? Heat and conditioned air pass easily pass through a poorly insulated attic. Conductive heat loss through the cold ceiling makes rooms directly beneath the attic even colder. Our trained auditors understand how to address any and all problems in the attic space.\n\n\nSYMPTOMS OF AN UNDER INSULATED ATTIC AND HOME\n\nN Cold drafts throughout the home, especially during the winter months.\nN Rooms and spaces below the attic become too hot or too cold even though other rooms may be just fine.\nN Your furnace or air conditioner are constantly running to keep up\nN High utility bills during harsher seasons such as sub-zero winter months and boiling hot summer months\n\nLearn More\nBASEMENT\n\nBasements and crawl spaces are an often overlooked, yet key component to your home’s envelope. The band joist is a particularly vulnerable area to air penetration. Even if you don’t spend much time in your basement, air flowing easily through the rim joist will create unusually cold temperatures in the floors above. Insulating your rim joist with spray foam will provide a one-two punch of air sealing and insulation. You’ll keep cold air and unwelcomed critters and pests out.\n\n\nBASEMENT INSULATION ADVANTAGES\n\nN Temperature and humidity becomes more stable to use as extra living space and storage\nN Significantly reduce the chance of mold and mildew\nN Prevent air leakage from outdoors into the home\nN Noticeable comfort difference on the floors above\nN Lower cooling and heating costs\n\nLearn More\nCONDITIONED SPACE & AIR SEALING\n\nThe conditioned space, also referred to as the living area, is the finished space of the home. The living area is where comfort issues are most noticeable but typically not where the root causes are located. Areas such as windows, doors, exterior walls, baseboards, and more are where air leaks occur. Using thermal imaging and various other inspection techniques, we’re able to identify areas of concern and provide insight into why as well as other contributing factors.\n\nDESIGN ADVANTAGES\n\nN Have a low environmental impact\nN Lower your heating and cooling costs\nN Improve your indoor air quality\nN Increase your home’s year-round comfort\nN Reduce noise by acting as a sound dampener\n\nLearn More\nGREENLINK PROVIDES INSULATION SERVICES FOR YOUR UNIQUE HOME\n\nNot sure where to start? Fill out our contact form, give us a call, or email and we will evaluate your home and recommend the best services, top quality material, and prioritize which areas to take care of first for peak performance. When these improvements are done right the first time by our certified experts and technicians, the project is a one-time improvement that requires no continued maintenance or up-keep.\n\nIf you want to make your home more comfortable and energy-efficient, contact us today to learn more about what options, types of material, and what we can use for your home.\n\nGet Started with a Free Estimate and Assessment\n815.205.5891 | info@greenlink.com\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions © 2021\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Up to 90% of homes are under insulated, the majority have nothing stopping air leaks, and many are unaware that these pain points such as being too hot, too cold, mold, ice dams, and more, are completely fixable! At Greenlink Energy Solutions, we provide complete home insulation solutions to eliminate problems such as uncomfortable rooms and high heating and cooling costs.\n\nOur insulation services involve the most up-to-date and modern processes to provide the highest quality results. We only use premium and professional grade insulation and building materials. Let our trained and certified experts provide insulation upgrades custom tailored to your home to increase comfort, decrease bills, and increase the overall value of your home.  To schedule your free inspection to get a free estimate to improve your home’s insulation, contact us today!\n\nINSULATION SERVICES TO IMPROVE YOUR HOME\nATTIC INSULATION\n\nAttics should always be properly insulated and air sealed. Even if yours isn’t finished, it needs to be insulated. An attic without sufficient insulation and air sealing leads to high bills, discomfort, and more.\n\nWALL INSULATION\n\nInsulation in walls prevents heat loss and provides additional sound proofing from outside or inside. It also increases the air tightness of your home.\n\nBASEMENT INSULATION\n\nFinished and unfinished basements should be insulated to prevent heat loss and unwanted air entering through the rim joist.\n\nSPRAY FOAM INSULATION\n\nThe most efficient insulation product. Much more effective per inch than any other, forms a strong air tight seal on any surface, and creates a vapor barrier. Closed cell spray foam works in all areas of the home.\n\nCRAWL SPACE INSULATION\n\nIf your home has a crawl space, it needs to be insulated, as well as properly weatherized and sealed. Otherwise, you’ll end up dealing with issues like moisture problems and soil vapor intrusion (which can decrease indoor air quality) such as radon gas.\n\nINSULATION REMOVAL\n\nInsulation needs to be removed when it is damp, wet, moldy, damaged by fire or when any other damage has occurred. We ensure insulation removal is a clean and easy process—no dust and no mess left behind.\n\nDUCT INSULATION\n\nDucts that are carrying warm air lose some of their energy through the duct walls as it passes through your building. If your existing ducts are in an unconditioned area, insulating them will greatly boost efficiency and prevent problems such as condensation.\n\nAIR SEALING\n\nAs air moves in and out through leaks around the home and even insulation, comfort decreases, utility bills increase, and the HVAC performance decreases. Air sealing prevents air leaks from causing damage to existing materials and significantly improves home performance.\n\nGREENLINK PROVIDES INSULATION SERVICES FOR YOUR UNIQUE HOME\n\nNot sure where to start? Fill out our contact form, give us a call, or email and we will evaluate your home and recommend the best insulation material and prioritize which areas to insulate to solve your problems. When these improvements are done right the first time by certified experts and technicians such as us, the project is a one-time improvement that requires no continued maintenance or up-keep.\n\nIf you want to make your home more comfortable and energy-efficient, contact an expert at Greenlink to learn more about insulation options, types of material, and what we can do to help you.\n\nContact us for a Free Assessment and Estimate Today!\n815.205.5966 | info@greenlink.com\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions © 2021\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

It’s been shown that indoor air is typically more polluted than fresh air from the outdoors. Using our 360° approach to building science, Greenlink Energy Solutions can fully evaluate your property to determine where improvements can be made that will have the greatest impact on occupant comfort. As such, we will always let you know if your Rockford, Illinois, home will currently benefit most from our roof and attic ventilation services, a whole-house ventilation system, or if another service should take precedence over improved ventilation in the home.\n\nBefore contacting us for our home ventilation services, you can read below for a list of the various signs that your home’s ventilation could be improved.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF POOR OR INADEQUATE ROOF OR ATTIC VENTILATION\n\n\nIf you’ve noticed or seen any of the following, you most likely have inadequate levels of roof or attic insulation:\n\n\nIncrease wear and tear on HVAC system – Without proper attic insulation, your home’s HVAC system will be working twice as hard when the weather is either too hot or too cold.\nYou’re experiencing uncomfortable temperatures in the home – If your Rockford, Illinois, home is either too hot or too humid, especially on the second floor of a two-story home, it is likely that you could benefit from Greenlink’s roof and attic ventilation services.\nYou’ve found mold and mildew in the home – This is typically indicative of moisture from the home’s exterior entering the home through poorly insulated areas such as the attic or crawl spaces. Learn more about our mold remediation service here.\nIce dam formation – Ensuring your home has no air leaks and is properly ventilated is the best way to avoid the formation of ice dams, which can damage your home. Learn more about our air sealing service here.\nInsulation damage – After being exposed to moisture, insulation can become damaged and grow mold. Mold remediation must be conducted prior to replacing attic insulation that has likely been affected by the mold.\n\n \n\nBENEFITS OF PROPER ROOF AND ATTIC VENTILATION\nIncrease the overall performance of the home, making your home more energy efficient and mitigates the onset of other problems, such as mold growth\nEnjoy more comfortable temperature levels in the home\nSave money associated with the cost of utility bills\nDecreased humidity levels in the home, which can help combat the growth of mold in the home\nGREENLINK’S ROOF AND ATTIC VENTILATION SOLUTIONS\nATTIC INTAKE AND EXHAUST VENTS\n\nGreenlink specializes in providing high-quality roof and attic ventilation services in Rockford, Illinois. The most common attic and roof ventilation solution we provide involves the installation of both intake and exhaust vents in your home’s attic. The intake vent will allow for the introduction of cooler outside air, and the exhaust vent will help expel hot air from the highest point of your attic. Both of these will help keep your attic cool, which improves overall home performance. We offer both static vents as well as powered and solar-powered vent fans. And every attic ventilation job involves the installation of rafter vents (also known as vent chutes or baffles).\n\nWHOLE-HOUSE VENTILATION SYSTEMS\n\nWe also offer whole-house ventilation systems if such a system is shown to make more sense for your Rockford-area home after our preliminary evaluation of the home using our 360° holistic approach to building science. We offer exhaust ventilation systems, supply ventilation systems, and balanced ventilation systems, which are meant to take in and push out equal amounts of fresh air and polluted inside air.\n\nIf you think your Rockford-area home is suffering from poor ventilation, contact the experienced roof and attic ventilation contractors of Greenlink Energy Solutions today. We will schedule a free site inspection, evaluation, and consultant.

The same can’t be said for exterior walls since the insulation spaces between studs are hidden behind drywall and exterior siding. However, insufficient wall insulation can have a huge impact on home comfort and efficiency. If you’re concerned about your comfort or energy efficiency, contact Greenlink today to speak with experienced exterior wall insulation installers near you in the Rockford, Illinois, area.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions is a Certified Trade-Ally Contractor with Nicor Gas of IL and Focus on Energy of WI, this means by insulating exterior walls, you can receive instant discounts on your estimate starting at $400 (Illinois) and $800 (Wisconsin).\n\n* Subject to terms and conditions of the weatherization programs. Most customers are instantly approved.\n\nTo include:\n\nAir Sealing around Windows / Doors\nThermal Camera showing missing insulation spots\nHot in summer / cold in winter\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF POORLY INSULATED WALLS\n\nIf you’ve noticed or seen any of the following, you most likely have inadequate levels of exterior wall insulation:\n\nFrozen pipes\nDrywall or panelling feels damp or cold (exterior wall should feel cold during summer) or the walls are freezing\nMoisture/internal condensation\nHoles in exterior walls (outside)\nFluctuating temperatures\nHigh energy bills\nExcessively hot in the summer\nOld insulation that has never been touched or has not been re-insulated in many years\n\nMoisture is the number one enemy to homeowners. When there’s a lack of exterior wall insulation, trapped moisture within the walls and beading up on the surface provides the perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow, and when it does it grows fast. Mold can seed and begin to spread within hours, in just a matter of days mold can cover an entire floor, and attach itself to other natural materials. Things like furniture, clothing, paper and even some trinkets and personal belongings can be easily destroyed by mold, and fast.\n\nIt’s not only uncomfortable to spend too much time in a cold home. Research has shown that living in a house with a temperature that is consistently below 68 degrees can cause a variety of mental and physical health problems, as well as exacerbate already existing conditions. Ailments such as asthma and high blood pressure can be worsened by consistently low indoor temperatures. With the potential for household mold added on top, it’s a recipe for an indoor air quality disaster.\n\nBENEFITS AND HOME PERFORMANCE INCREASES\nComfort\nRetain heat\nFurnace run less\nNon cold wall\nEfficiency\nOUR EXTERIOR WALL INSULATION INSTALLATION PROCESS\n\nNon-invasive.

But this insulation does nothing to make your basement more comfortable and energy efficient. The other limitation of fiberglass insulation is that it can’t stop air leakage that causes comfort, energy and moisture problems. At Greenlink Energy Solutions, we provide residents of Rockford, Illinois, and the surrounding areas with basement insulation installation services to ensure this very important part of the home is thoroughly protected.\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions takes a 360° holistic approach to building science. We use to evaluate your home as a singular system made up of the various components that contribute to your energy efficiency, including your insulation, ventilation, and more. This allows us to offer a variety of basement insulation installation solutions designed specifically for the basement environment and tailored to your specific property. Your local Greenlink contractor can inspect your home and help you decide on the best insulation plan for your basement.\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions is a Trade-Ally with Nicor Gas of Illinois and Focus on Energy of Wisconsin.

You’ll often hear “rim joist” or “band joist” to describe the area where your exterior basement walls meet the outside. This is a common area for air penetration, which can lead to cold floors and temperatures in the winter and warm temperatures in the summer. Moisture damage and pest infestation can also occur in poorly insulated basements. \n\nWe understand that sometimes not everything’s about being hot or cold. Sometimes you just want some peace and quiet, or maybe just a private space for your hobbies. Certain types of insulation are perfect for sound abatement. The joists of basement ceilings are a perfect place to insulate if you’d like to create a sound-resistant environment for your loved ones.  \n\nFirst Name *\nLast Name *\nPhone *\nEmail Address *\nZip Code *\nAreas and Services of Interest (Optional)\nPick a Service\nGeneral Insulation\nHome Energy Audit / Assessment\nAttic\nBasement\nCrawl Space\nLiving Area\nWindows & Doors\nSpray Foam Insulation\nMessage *\nIf you are human, leave this field blank.\nGet Started\n779.774.3378 | info@greenlink.com\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions © 2021\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

Untreated and unmaintained crawl spaces can be a major problem in the building envelope. They’re more susceptible to moisture, deterioration, and naturally become damp. Damp environments are unhealthy, harboring mold, and create an ideal living area for pets. If your crawl space is not insulated, contact the pros at Greenlink Energy Solutions today to receive a quote for crawl space insulation service near Rockford, Illinois.\n\nYour crawl space affects the interior of your home. The living space of your home can be infiltrated with mold, earth gases, rodents and other allergens if your crawl space is not properly sealed. As much as 40 percent of the air you breathe while in your home is coming from your crawlspace. Most crawl spaces are home to furnaces, ductwork, gas lines, water pipes, etc.; these areas need to be protected and insulated to increase efficiency, life span, and allow for a healthy comfortable home.\n\nOur 360° building science approach includes insulating crawl spaces to create a clean, efficient space that will make your home more comfortable.

We set up plastic sheeting from the ceiling to the floor, over furniture, and any other belongings in the surrounding work area. We then seal everything down to ensure the work area is air tight.\nClean and Sanitize – We’ll remove existing materials and use HEPA filtered vacuums for any debris. We’ll remove the stains from and neutralize any areas showing symptoms of mold & mildew or remnants from pests. We then apply an inhibitor to discourage any future growth.\nEncapsulate – We’ll install 12 millimeter thick sheeting over the floor and exterior walls to prevent gas and moisture from entering.\nInsulate and Seal – Once everything is cleaned, sanitized, and encapsulated, we begin insulating around the exterior walls, rim joist, and if requested—the ceiling!\n\n\nDo you have a damp, leaky, or problem causing crawl space?

As a homeowner, you’re likely aware of how important proper insulation in the home can be, especially when it comes to more vulnerable areas of the home such as basements and attics. But many neglect to consider the magnitude of ensuring your ducts are sealed and properly insulated. This can help you save on energy costs by as much as 20 percent!\n\nAt Greenlink, we apply a 360° approach to building science that essentially leaves no stone unturned where improving your home’s efficiency and energy savings are concerned. If the first step toward improving your home’s efficiency and energy savings is to properly seal and insulate your ductwork, we’ll offer you solutions before getting started. But our approach guarantees that we will fully evaluate the entire home and can make recommendations for other services that either need to be addressed first or that will provide a greater impact on energy efficiency and costs, like properly insulating a basement, attic, or crawl space.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nGREENLINK DUCT SEALING AND INSULATION SERVICES – WHAT WE OFFER\n\nAir Duct Sealing Services – Our skilled technicians are capable of properly sealing all of your ducts to ensure there are no air leaks present—and they can even seal otherwise unreachable portions of your home’s ductwork. We make use of a combination of liquid mastic and aluminum foil tape.\n\nAir Duct Insulation Services – Duct sealing and duct insulation go hand-in-hand. Ductwork insulation cannot be applied if the ducts have not been sealed prior. And it should be noted that all ductwork in unconditioned areas of the home (such as the attic or a crawl space) need to be insulated to remain in accordance with applicable code requirements.\n\nAir Duct Balancing Services – If you’ve identified areas of the home that either don’t warm up enough in the winter or remain too hot during the summer, it’s likely that the air flow in your home is not evenly distributed. Air duct balancing refers to the process of ensuring that each room in your home is receiving an even and appropriate amount of air flow when compared to other rooms in the house.\n\nTHE GREENLINK ADVANTAGE\n\nOur 360° approach to building science will identify whether or not your Rockford, Illinois, home requires air duct sealing and/or air duct insulation and will also identify any other areas of the home where insulation or ventilation could be improved to drastically improve energy efficiency and associated costs.\n\nIf you know for a fact that your air ducts need work or just wish to have your home checked by certified experts, contact Greenlink Energy Solutions today.

Spray foam insulation outperforms other insulation materials in terms of R-value, resistance to mold and moisture damage, durability, air sealing, and versatility.\n\nAs experienced spray foam insulation contractors, we know that spray foam can be used in a variety of different spaces in the home; including attics, crawl spaces, walls, and more. At Greenlink Energy Solutions, we specialize in spray foam insulation installation that makes your home more efficient and comfortable. And, as we employ a 360° approach to building science when we evaluate a home, we can help identify any other areas of the home that can be improved to help aid the building’s energy efficiency, air quality, and more.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how spray foam can help your home, call us for a consultation and estimate. Or read on below to learn about the benefits of having spray foam installed by experienced spray foam insulation contractors.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nBENEFITS OF CLOSED CELL SPRAY FOAM INSULATION INSTALLATION\nUtilizing spray foam insulation actually adds structural stability and durability to your home because it adds strength to framing and sheathing.\nWhen compared with other forms of insulation, spray foam boasts an impressive R-value, which is 55–60 percent greater than other types of insulation.\nDue to the fact that spray foam expands and is a very strong adhesive, it is more efficient than other forms of insulation.\nSpray foam helps seal off the home against air leaks and creates an up-to-code moisture barrier or vapor barrier.\nSpray foam also offers an impressive degree of soundproofing when used as an insulator and is comparable to rock wool’s soundproofing capability.\nSpray foam is highly resistant to water damage unlike other insulators like fiberglass, which can hold up to 2.5x its weight in moisture.\nWon’t compress, fall out of place or lose R-value like fiberglass\nClosed-cell spray foam is waterproof and does not support mold growth\nWHAT DOES SPRAY FOAM INSULATION COST?\n\nBefore you decide on spray foam or another method of insulation, it’s important to understand the superiority of spray foam compared to traditional materials. When compared to fiberglass batts, spray foam offers nearly double the R-value per inch, achieves air-sealing and insulation in one step, won’t be damaged by mold or moisture, and won’t settle, compress, or otherwise be damaged to the point it needs replacement.\n\nSpray foam insulation is typically priced by volume, meaning your cost will depend on how much material you need to use to insulate your space, although other factors may influence price as well. In almost all cases, the cost of spray foam insulation is more than worth it, as it’s a once and done upgrade that will not only provide energy savings in your home, but also improve your home’s overall comfort and structural integrity.\n\nTHE GREENLINK SPRAY FOAM INSULATION PROCESS\n\nSpray foam insulation can be messy and difficult to remove from areas where it shouldn’t be. But as experienced spray foam insulation contractors, we have an intensive process to ensure there’s no mess and guarantee the safety of every occupant (including pets) in the home.\n\nPreparation: We’ll cover everything in the immediate area and surrounding areas with plastic sheeting from the ceiling to the floor and over any furniture or fixtures.\nCleaning: Removing dust, debris, and other materials in the work area is crucial. This allows the foam to form the strongest bond and adhesion to the material as possible bringing it to peak efficiency.\nApplication: Our spray foam technicians go through rigorous training and are certified by the spray foam manufacturer (Icynene®) as well. We guarantee a clean, efficient, and building-code level installation of closed cell spray foam.\nClean and Trim: We’ll trim up and smooth the foam to the perfect level for each type of project. Once your project is complete, we guarantee a squeaky clean work area. Nobody likes picking up after you just paid someone to do the work for you.\n\nLooking for spray foam insulation?

But when compared to other materials used for insulation purposes, cellulose insulation installation is a practical and cost-effective method with a number of other advantages associated with it. Learn more about the benefits of using loose-fill cellulose insulation in your Rockford, Illinois, area home or contact us now to get started.\n\nContact Greenlink Energy Solutions\nWHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF CELLULOSE INSULATION INSTALLATION?\n\nOne major benefit associated with cellulose insulation is that it is made up of mostly recycled materials and utilizes more recycled material than other forms of insulation. It also has low levels of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) when compared with other insulation types. Further, we mitigate the amount of cellulose insulation dust that can be later inhaled by utilizing mineral oil additives to reduce dust.\n\nIts R-value, which refers to the insulating material’s resistance to heat transmission, is about R-3.5 per inch of loose-fill cellulose insulation. Couple this with the fact that loose-fill cellulose insulation can conform to most other obstructions found in walls or attics, such as cracks, and that it can be applied at various thicknesses for more or less thermal insulation, and the advantage of cellulose over others begins to become quite apparent. This is among the most versatile insulation materials around as it can easily fit into tight spaces, does not require an additional moisture barrier, and is cost effective.\n\nWHERE CAN CELLULOSE INSULATION BE USED?\nATTIC INSULATION\n\nThis insulation can be blown into walls or under floors to ensure your attic is as insulated as can be, which translates to energy savings for you.\n\nWALL INSULATION\n\nIt can also be used to insulate finished exterior and interior walls. It can be easily injected into and behind interior drywall and can help insulate any cracks in exterior walls to avoid air leaks.\n\nFLOOR INSULATION\n\nCellulose insulation can be easily utilized to insulate floors as it can be blown under your floorboards at the thickness needed to provide your desired level of insulation. You will typically see this used for floors with cavities like those found in rooms above your garage, or the attic itself, and more.\n\nBLOWN CELLULOSE INSULATION IS OUR PRODUCT OF CHOICE\n\nAt Greenlink, we take a 360° holistic approach to building science where we fully evaluate the home as a system made up of various components such as ventilation, insulation, energy efficiency, and more. This allows us to identify the areas that need improvement in order of importance. In many cases, proper insulation or energy efficiency is paramount as it is directly translated into energy savings. And when it comes to floor, wall, or attic insulation, blown cellulose is our product of choice.\n\nCellulose insulation installation is the most cost effective choice for most home insulation areas.

Animal waste can deteriorate insulation and create odor problems within the home. If not addressed, the problem worsens over time, as odors attract more wildlife, and moisture turns to mold and rot.\n\nMany attics have issues with water infiltration, degraded insulation and rodents. To solve this problem, we offer thorough attic restoration services in Rockford, IL. We can restore your attic by cleaning it out, sealing gaps and installing new insulation – making it as good as new. We start by assessing its current condition and determining what materials can remain.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nSYMPTOMS AND PAIN POINTS OF AN UNDERPERFORMING ATTIC\nHigh utility bills—your furnace or air conditioner always running to keep up\nUncomfortable temperatures throughout the home or in focused areas\nBlack, white, and brown discoloration on the roof deck—these could be symptoms of mold and mildew damage\nHigher than safe levels of moisture which are absorbed by existing insulation and can lead to air pollutants like mold colonies forming within\nPROBLEMS OF PEST INFESTATIONS IN THE ATTIC\nAnimal feces and urine in your insulation\nLeftover food and food waste\nAnimal and urine odors\nMold growing in urine soaked areas\nRoundworms, parasites and their eggs\nAnimal scents which can attract more pests\nBENEFITS OF ATTIC RESTORATION\nLowers heating and cooling costs\nKeeps pests and moisture out of your home\nForms a continuous barrier on any area applied\nSignificantly reduces noise by acting as a sound dampener compared to popular insulation materials\nStops drafts by sealing every gap, crack, or opening as it expands to fill the area\nOUR ATTIC RESTORATION PROCESS\n\nUsing our 360° holistic approach of building science, we begin with the attic. \n\nPreparation and Removal – Building materials (insulation/wiring/debris), clean up (“for example” fixing wiring) of dust/shit. We prep the entire area with plastic all the way up to the ceiling, covering everything. We create negative pressure and use high-powered fans to ensure no dust enters other areas of the home.\nSanitize and Contain – Use professional-grade mold and mildew neutralizer and stain remover on attic floor, roof deck (explain what this is, some people don’t get it. *only if it works), rafters (roof), joists (floor). We apply a wood-safe primer coating that inhibits mold (spencer.. Aka mold killing primer)\nAir Seal – We reduce air migrating into the attic and air leaking into your home by using a combination of fire-rated foam, caulk, drywall, and insulated foam board. We target key areas including: plumbing vents, electrical and other penetrations, mechanical chases, drop soffits, top plates, and more.\nVentilate – Your attic needs to breathe and requires proper ventilation. We’ll ensure air flow is maximized by installing baffles, or vent chutes, in every eave and block the bottom to prevent wind washing. \nRe-insulate – Once air sealing and ventilation are complete, we’ll start blowing in cellulose insulation.

Mold can cause a variety of health issues. Everyone has seen mold at some point in their lives—especially on food. It is important to begin the mold removal process as soon as possible to prevent further damage. If not removed by a professional, mold produces spores which can travel and affect new areas in the home.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\n\nUNDERSTANDING MOLD —WHEN, HOW, & WHY\n\nMold can present itself on almost any surface in the home. Mold spores rely on higher levels of moisture to spread and water exposure can increase its growth which leads to harmful irritants and allergens in the air.\n\nMicroscopic mold spores exist in almost every environment—indoors and outdoors. It is the intensity and speed of growth of a colony that is important to remove. These mold colonies are the producers of allergens, irritants, and air pollutants.\n\nMold is present in almost every environment including outdoors and indoors.\nMold spores are microscopic, float along in the air, and can enter your home through outdoor intakes around air conditioning or heating systems, cling to clothes or a pet, and even air leaks and gaps by windows and doors\nMold spores thrive on moisture which leads to rapid colony development and growth.\nBefore mold removal can begin, all sources and causes must be addressed or removal is pointless.\nA strong musty odor is produced that can be a simple way to find larger areas within the living space.\nKeep indoor humidity below 45 percent as an effective preventative method.\n\nCHOOSE THE MOLD REMOVAL EXPERTS\n\nContact the experts at Greenlink Energy Solutions with the experience and knowledge of mold, mildew, and bacterial growth to provide professional-grade mold removal services and restoration.

If there is no air sealing in the attic space, then the insulation will have degraded quickly and rapidly; it also is probably holding onto any moisture and pollutants that have passed through it. Other scenarios such as roof leaks (water damage), condensation, mold, mildew, and age can contribute to needing the existing insulation removed.\n\nWe want to ensure that your insulation removal is done correctly. This means that when you contact us for insulation removal service near Rockford, Illinois, the entire area will have its insulation, building materials, and debris removed before the area is thoroughly sanitized.  .\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nWHY SHOULD I REMOVE MY EXISTING INSULATION?\n\nIf you’ve noticed or seen any of the following, you most likely have inadequate levels of attic insulation:\n\nCan be a source of mold growth which in turn spreads into the home\nPest such as mice will chew through and create tunnels soiling the area and degrading insulation\nOld age; old insulation will be severely degraded and virtually non-effective\nCreates a clean work area to check wiring, look for mold & mildew, and allows for efficient work\nIf you plan on adding new insulation, then removing old or damaged insulation is a must\n\nAs we would often suggest improving your home’s energy efficiency first as part of our 360° holistic approach to building science, our highest priority is usually to remove old insulation so that it can be replaced with new, more effective insulation.\n\nTHE INSULATION REMOVAL PROCESS\n\nOur insulation removal service involves the following steps:\n\nPreparation – We never want to damage property or leave a mess behind. We set up plastic sheeting from the ceiling to the floor, over furniture, and any other belongings in the surrounding work area. We then seal everything down to ensure the work area is air tight.\nNegative Pressure – This fancy term means once the work area is air tight, we attach a strong fan as a type of exhaust to the nearest external opening, also referred to as a dedicated termination. This fan will significantly reduce any pollutants such as dust from entering the living area. We incorporate this practice with almost every service.\nRemoval – Using a 20 horsepower True-HEPA filter vacuum, we attach a large diameter heavy-duty hose and begin removing any loose material from the area. Combined with the negative pressure and manual removal of debris, the previously insulated space will be squeaky clean!\nSanitation – If needed, we will remove the stains from and neutralize any areas showing symptoms of mold & mildew or remnants from pests. We then apply an inhibitor to discourage any future growth.\nGET A FRESH START AND REMOVE INSULATION WITH GREENLINK\n\nIf you think you might need insulation removal, looking for an estimate, or even if you just have some questions, give the certified experts at Greenlink Energy Solutions a call at (779) 774-3378, or email info@usgreenlink.com today!\n\nFirst Name *\nLast Name *\nPhone *\nEmail Address *\nZip Code *\nAreas and Services of Interest (Optional)\nPick a Service\nGeneral Insulation\nHome Energy Audit / Assessment\nAttic\nBasement\nCrawl Space\nLiving Area\nWindows & Doors\nSpray Foam Insulation\nMessage *\nIf you are human, leave this field blank.\nGet Started\n779.774.3378 | info@greenlink.com\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions © 2021\nGreenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.Greenlink Energy Solutions, Inc.\n\n5 Star Rating by Jennifer C.\n09/13/21\nStar Rating by",

The EPA estimates, on average, that 15% of total heating and cooling costs can be eliminated and reduced through air sealing the home. These sources of air leaks and air infiltration lead to an inefficient and uncomfortable home.\n\nWe at Greenlink Energy Solutions are your local air sealing experts. We approach your home using our 360° holistic building science approach. This means we address your home rather than solving one problem but not others, by taking care of all problematic areas.\n\n\nContact us to get a free thermal imaging inspection to identify every source of air leakage and infiltration. We can help eliminate drafts and leaks to bring your home to peak levels of comfort and performance.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nTHE SYMPTOMS OF A LACK OF AIR SEALING, LEAKS, AND INFILTRATION\n\nYou may already know where some air leaks occur within your home, such as drafts coming from exterior windows and or doors. What about the sources of air leakage and infiltration that can’t be as easily felt? \n\nIf you’ve noticed or experienced any of the following, your home probably requires some air sealing:\n\nCold or hot rooms, uneven temperatures through the home\nDrafty rooms—you can feel the cold or warm air flowing from the area\nHigh heating and cooling bills during the colder months or warmer months\nFurnace or AC running almost continuously to keep the home comfortable\nIce dams forming along the roof or gutters\nDry air inside the home, especially during winter\nNoticeable dust that settles and forms quickly\n\nAt Greenlink, our certified experts conduct a thorough assessment using professional-grade equipment. We’ll identify every source with a thermal imaging camera in combination with a blower door test; not only can we see air leaks but also areas without sufficient insulation and other problematic areas.\n\nBENEFITS OF AIR SEALING YOUR HOME\n\nBesides comfort, there are a plethora of long-term noticeable benefits by having your home professionally air sealed. Our goal is to increase the performance of your home, making it more efficient.\n\nThe top proven benefits of whole home air sealing are:\n\nImproved Comfort – Sealing homes tightly typically results in fewer drafts throughout the home, and sometimes, noise reduction. \n\nLower Utility Bills – Air leakage and improperly installed insulation can waste 20 percent or more of the energy used to heat or cool a home. With effective air sealing and insulation, heating and cooling systems will not need to work as hard.\n\nImproved Indoor Air Quality – A tighter home envelope reduces the amount of humidity, dust, pollen, and pests that can enter the home and improve indoor air quality.\n\nIncreased Durability of Your Home – When warm air leaks through a home’s floors, walls, and attic, it can come in contact with cooler surfaces where condensation can occur. Moisture in these hidden places encourages mold growth, ruins insulation, and compromises the structural elements of the home. If your attic does not have enough ventilation, the chances of high moisture, condensation, and the damage increases. Therefore it’s important to address your home as a system. Since many components are at play in causing problems, addressing and correcting each of them is necessary to ensure the best possible performance of your home and to prevent future problems from areas that were not previously considered and corrected.\n\nImproved Energy Efficiency – When your home’s heating and cooling systems aren’t working as hard to compensate for leaks, gaps, and drafts, you’re using less energy, saving money, and increasing your home’s overall performance. In fact, energy.gov estimates you could save 10%-20% on your home’s annual heating and cooling bills from sealing uncontrolled air leaks.\n\nOUR 360° BUILDING SCIENCE BASED AIR SEALING PROCESS\n\nAir infiltration and leakage account for up to 30% of a home’s heat loss according to the US Department of Energy. Which is why we seal every gap, crack, nook, and cranny possible to increase the air tightness and efficiency of your home. We combine air sealing in the attic with air sealing in your home’s living area with insulation and ventilation. This holistic approach when analyzing a home means all areas of the home are addressed to improve comfort, indoor air quality (less dust, pollen, and pollutants), and an overall better performing home.\n\nA Blower Door Test is a kit that consists of an airtight frame, a powerful fan, and a mini-computer. The frame is assembled in an exterior doorway, most commonly the front door, the fan is inserted, and then turned on. By forcing air out of the home, we depressurize it forcing air to come into the home, allowing us to identify all sources of air infiltration and air leakage in Step 2. From this, we gather the CFM @ 50 and the ACH @ 50; these are numbers that in-short, tell us how air tight your home is. The average home should be at 5 ACH@50 while the leakiest homes fluctuate around 7 or above.  \nThermal Imaging is a professional-grade camera, allowing us to quickly visualize and identify all sources of infiltration or leakage. We store these photos to show pre and post improvements. After identifying, we move on to our targeted air sealing process within the living area of the home.\nTargeted Air Sealing means we use the previous information to install premium products that prevent unwanted air flow where the sources are. This includes the areas around your windows, doors, trim, outlets, utility and electrical penetrations, and more. This includes but not limited to: gasket foam, latex clear caulk (paintable and hidden), fire-rated foam, and moisture resistant drywall.\nAttic Air Sealing is where we seal every area where conditioned air (warm or cold) could rise into the attic space or come into the home from the attic space. We target key locations of major leakage such as plumbing vents, electrical penetrations, mechanical chases, chimney flues, drop soffits, and top plates.\n\nThink you’re suffering from any of the symptoms and problem areas, or your home could benefit from air sealing?

It’s been shown that indoor air is typically more polluted than fresh air from the outdoors. Using our 360° approach to building science, Greenlink Energy Solutions can fully evaluate your property to determine where improvements can be made that will have the greatest impact on occupant comfort. As such, we will always let you know if your Rockford, Illinois, home will currently benefit most from our roof and attic ventilation services, a whole-house ventilation system, or if another service should take precedence over improved ventilation in the home.\n\nBefore contacting us for our home ventilation services, you can read below for a list of the various signs that your home’s ventilation could be improved.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF POOR OR INADEQUATE ROOF OR ATTIC VENTILATION\n\nIf you’ve noticed or seen any of the following, you most likely have inadequate levels of roof or attic insulation:\n\nIncrease wear and tear on HVAC system – Without proper attic insulation, your home’s HVAC system will be working twice as hard when the weather is either too hot or too cold.\nYou’re experiencing uncomfortable temperatures in the home – If your Rockford, Illinois, home is either too hot or too humid, especially on the second floor of a two-story home, it is likely that you could benefit from Greenlink’s roof and attic ventilation services.\nYou’ve found mold and mildew in the home – This is typically indicative of moisture from the home’s exterior entering the home through poorly insulated areas such as the attic or crawl spaces. Learn more about our mold remediation service here.\nIce dam formation – Ensuring your home has no air leaks and is properly ventilated is the best way to avoid the formation of ice dams, which can damage your home. Learn more about our air sealing service here.\nInsulation damage – After being exposed to moisture, insulation can become damaged and grow mold. Mold remediation must be conducted prior to replacing attic insulation that has likely been affected by the mold.\nBENEFITS OF PROPER ROOF AND ATTIC VENTILATION\nIncrease the overall performance of the home, making your home more energy efficient and mitigates the onset of other problems, such as mold growth\nEnjoy more comfortable temperature levels in the home\nSave money associated with the cost of utility bills\nDecreased humidity levels in the home, which can help combat the growth of mold in the home\n\n \n\nGREENLINK’S ROOF AND ATTIC VENTILATION SOLUTIONS\nATTIC INTAKE AND EXHAUST VENTS\n\nGreenlink specializes in providing high-quality roof and attic ventilation services in Rockford, Illinois. The most common attic and roof ventilation solution we provide involves the installation of both intake and exhaust vents in your home’s attic. The intake vent will allow for the introduction of cooler outside air, and the exhaust vent will help expel hot air from the highest point of your attic. Both of these will help keep your attic cool, which improves overall home performance. We offer both static vents as well as powered and solar-powered vent fans. And every attic ventilation job involves the installation of rafter vents (also known as vent chutes or baffles).\n\nWHOLE-HOUSE VENTILATION SYSTEMS\n\nWe also offer whole-house ventilation systems if such a system is shown to make more sense for your Rockford-area home after our preliminary evaluation of the home using our 360° holistic approach to building science. We offer exhaust ventilation systems, supply ventilation systems, and balanced ventilation systems, which are meant to take in and push out equal amounts of fresh air and polluted inside air.\n\nIf you think your Rockford-area home is suffering from poor ventilation, contact the experienced roof and attic ventilation contractors of Greenlink Energy Solutions today. We will schedule a free site inspection, evaluation, and consultant.

But windows and doors get extra attention because they also need to look good. When the paint cracks or peels around a window frame or the weather-stripping comes loose around a door, these details also detract from a home’s appearance.\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions works with many of the most popular manufacturers and only provides window and door installation of top-of-the-line, energy-efficient windows and doors across the country. Our energy technicians will help you identify the best new or replacement windows and doors for your home or any other services that may aid your home’s energy efficiency. This is thanks to the 360° approach to building science that we use when evaluating each unique home. This allows us to identify which improvements to the home will have the greatest impact and which should be prioritized most highly.\n\nGET YOUR FREE ASSESSMENT & ESTIMATE TODAY\nHOW TO PICK THE RIGHT REPLACEMENT WINDOWS\n\nWhether you are choosing windows for a new house or replacement windows for an existing house, it’s smart to have your wish list ready – a checklist of all the features your windows should have. Good windows should be:\n\nEnergy efficient – The National Fenestration Registration Council (NFRC) rates all major brands of windows for air leakage, U-value, and heat-blocking ability – three qualities that determine overall energy efficiency. These ratings are clearly displayed on the standard NFRC label attached to the window unit.\nAttractive – Different wood grain and color options (available from some manufacturers) provide you with more style choices.\nDurable and maintenance-free – Vinyl windows take the lead in this category because they never need painting and they can’t be damaged by moisture.\nEasy to clean. Window frames that tilt inward enable you to clean the exterior-facing glass from inside the house. This makes window cleaning faster and safer.\nAvailable in a wide range of styles and sizes. Double hung, bows, bays, casements, picture windows and more. Most houses have different types of windows. Make sure your contractor can satisfy your style and size requirements.\nProtected with a great warranty. Many manufacturers only warrant their windows for 10, 15 or 20 years.\nInstalled by experts. Make sure your windows are installed by skilled technicians who place a high value on good craftsmanship.\nEXTERIOR DOORS ALSO NEED TO BE APPEALING AND EFFICIENT\n\nMany of the details explained for windows above also apply to exterior doors. Older, solid-wood exterior doors are often replaced with doors that have fiberglass or steel skins and foam insulation cores. Fiberglass exterior doors are usually considered better for several reasons. They resist denting and heat transfer better than steel doors. Also, the fiberglass door skin can be textured and stained to resemble a solid wood door.\n\nHomeowners interested in improving comfort and energy efficiency often decide to replace older sliding glass doors with new, more efficient units. The vinyl frames used on new Sunrise sliding glass doors outperform wood and metal frames used on other “sliders” in terms of durability, energy efficiency, and maintenance-free features.\n\nFIND A CONTRACTOR FOR YOUR REPLACEMENT WINDOWS AND DOORS\n\nGreenlink Energy Solutions specializes in new and replacement window and door installation in Rockford, Illinois. Because of our understanding of home energy performance, we can help you pick windows and doors that will look great and also save you money on your utilities.

If your home leaves you feeling unwell, you may be suffering from poor indoor air quality. The professionals at Greenlink Energy Solutions are here to help by providing an array of indoor air quality services!\n\nAccording to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air quality refers to the air quality within and around buildings and structures as it relates to the health and comfort of its occupants. Indoor air quality is affected by temperature, humidity, ventilation, and chemical or biological contaminants found within the building.\n\nDo you have any reason to suspect that your home’s air quality is poor? Read on to learn more about the symptoms commonly associated with poor air quality in the home.\n\nINDOOR AIR QUALITY SERVICES TO IMPROVE YOUR HOME\nAIR PURIFICATION SYSTEMS\n\nFrom media filters to complete HEPA air filtration systems, we’ll help you choose an option that meets your needs and budget.\n\nDEHUMIDIFIERS\n\nWhole-house dehumidifiers keep moisture levels low, preventing microbial growth and reducing dust mite populations.\n\nENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATOR (ERV)\n\nBalanced ventilation from an ERV ensures consistent air changes to keep your indoor air clean\n\nUV LIGHT SYSTEMS\n\nGot mold on your indoor coil? UV light systems prevent those contaminants from growing and help clean the air passing through your HVAC system.\n\nCOMMON SYMPTOMS OF POOR INDOOR AIR QUALITY\n\nIf you’ve noticed, felt, or seen any of the following symptoms in yourself or others, you are more than likely suffering from poor indoor air quality and large amount of pollutants:\n\nHeadaches, fatigue, sore eyes, burning nose\nWorsening allergies\nRespiratory issues\nFlu-like symptoms\nSERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS CAUSED BY POOR INDOOR AIR QUALITY\nHeart disease\nCancer\nOther serious, long-term conditions\nDeath, when carbon monoxide or other pollutants are present in high concentrations\n\nCommon complaints of indoor air pollutants that can directly affect occupant comfort, health and productivity and contribute to poor indoor environmental air quality, create health concerns and questions, and may lead to claims of sick building syndrome (SBS) include those from biological pollutants, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), indoor particulate matter, asbestos, mold, and secondhand smoke. Sick building syndrome claims arise in situations where building occupants experience detrimental effects they or their physicians have linked to time spent within a built environment/building without the identification of a specific illness or cause.\n\nBENEFITS OF REDUCING POLLUTANTS AND INCREASING AIR QUALITY\n\nClean air may help prevent health problems including asthma, allergies, or other serious conditions. Chemicals from cleaning products or other items that are brought into the home may circulate throughout your property. When not properly filtered, they may lead to a wide range of problems from breathing difficulties to cancer. Mold is another problem that results from moisture in the air. Mold spores commonly cause allergies to react and other respiratory issues to develop. Other indoor air pollutants may include cigarette smoke, dust, or pet dander. All of these items may cause negative health side effects.\n\nWhen a home’s indoor air quality is good, it will be a great relief for the lungs. In the home, a person will notice the difference and will suffer less allergy or asthma attacks. It is imperative to breathe air that contains no pollutants in order to live the highest quality of life possible to avoid the possible onset of asthmatic-like symptoms or other respiratory ailments.\n\nOUR INDOOR AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS\n\nWhen you contact us for our indoor air quality services in Rockford, Illinois, we’ll start by listening to your specific concerns. We can also complete a blower door test, conduct an air quality index and content test (for VOCs, HCHO, and more), and perform a thermal imaging analysis.

By upgrading and installing new systems, you can save hundreds of dollars each year on utility bills and even more over the lifespan of the system. You’ll also significantly improve air quality, meaning a reduced amount of pollutants in the air, leading to a home at maximum efficiency and performance.\n\nContact us for a Free Assessment and Estimate Today!\nMECHANICAL SERVICES TO IMPROVE YOUR HOME\nDESIGN AND CONSULTATION\n\nOur trained HVAC engineers will evaluate the layout and design of your home to design a plan that emphasizes maximum performance and efficiency; this means no area goes unnoticed and every aspect of the system is taken into consideration. We’ll evaluate your current heating and cooling systems to determine what type, size, and system is best for your home.There is more than just heating and cooling but purification as well. We’re not just looking at the heating or cooling units but the system in its entirety: the unit, the ductwork throughout the home, size of the home, volume of the rooms, and more. Our goal is to implement a system that places your home in the top percent of performing homes in the area.\n\nHEATING & COOLING\n\nHeating and cooling systems are the largest single consumers of energy in buildings. These systems condition the air within a building so that occupants are comfortable. Heating and cooling systems consist mainly of chillers, boilers, cooling towers, and pumps. There are central heating and cooling systems, and unitary systems that combine heating and cooling. Opportunities exist for improvement to both central and unitary systems.\n\nMeasure your heating and cooling loads.\nCorrectly size your heating and cooling systems.\nReplace your chillers with new, more energy-efficient, non-chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) models.\nUpgrade your heating and cooling system components.\nInstall variable-speed drives (VSDs) on your pumps and cooling tower fans.\nOptimize operation of your heating and cooling systems.\nPURIFICATION & FILTRATION SYSTEMS\n\nWe install purification and filtration systems to ensure the air you breathe is clean and healthy.\n\nERV VENTILATION SYSTEMS\n\nERVs, or Energy Recovery Ventilators, are systems that draw clean, fresh air into your house and remove stale air. They also capture contaminants, pollutants, allergens, pllen, and more, ensuring any air that enters is clean and healthy.\n\nBATHROOM VENTILATION\n\nWithout a bath fan, or an insufficient one, humidity in the air builds up from showers and causes mold, mildew, and more. Upgrade or install a high-efficiency rated bath fan to properly ventilate your bathroom.\n\nKITCHEN RANGE\n\nNo one likes grease, soot, and smoke damage in their kitchen. It also spreads throughout the home. Get a vent above your stove that goes outside instead of recycling polluted air.\n\nGREENLINK PROVIDES MECHANICAL SERVICES FOR YOUR UNIQUE HOME\n\nNot sure where to start?
